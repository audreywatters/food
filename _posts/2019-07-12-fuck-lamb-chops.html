<p>I made Cornish pasties this week for the very first time, and I fucking nailed it. The crust was perfect, and the filling was perfect, and the local grocery store even sells HP sauce (in its &#8220;ethnic foods&#8221; section, no less). So perfect. I had one cold for breakfast, which I thought as I ate it seemed a bad idea and the best idea all at once.</p>

<p>Pasties are the final dish of the three (British) meat dishes that I&#8217;ve now mastered. The other two: sausage rolls and shepherd&#8217;s pie. So I can say, with gritted teeth, that yes, I will eat lamb or pork or beef. I am not a picky eater! (Reader: I am.)</p>

<p>I should note here, I suppose, that I used ground beef in my pasties. I knew that I couldn&#8217;t handle eating steak. Too gristly. Too chewy. Too muscly. So yes, I will eat lamb or pork or beef, served in a traditional dish of my people, as long as that meat is <em>ground</em>.</p>

<p>I tried to cook a rack of lamb tonight. It&#8217;s my second attempt to do so. The first try came out of the oven virtually raw, and even though I extended the cooking time tonight well beyond what any recipe called for, they were still too rare for my taste. I threw the chops into a skillet and gave them a quick sear, and that seemed to do the trick. But even so, I was confronted with such a fatty piece of flesh, with tiny pieces of baby sheep meat. And I remembered: I <em>hate</em> lamb chops. </p>

<p>Well, truth be told, I&#8217;ve never forgotten. And I don&#8217;t hate lamb chops per se. I hate all the fat. And I hate having to sit at the dinner table and clean my plate of the fat that I&#8217;d carefully cut away and pushed to the side. I had a memorable fight with my aunt when I was 9 or so about whether or not I should be eating the fat of the lamb chop. She insisted I should. I insisted I&#8217;d barf. I put a far too fatty piece of meat in my mouth tonight and gagged. Run and play more, little lamb. You are too fat.</p>

<p>I have a list where I write down &#8220;Meal Ideas That Don&#8217;t Suck&#8221; &#8211; these are the recipes I&#8217;ve nailed. I have another list where I track &#8220;Meal Ideas to Work On.&#8221; Rack of lamb has been on the latter for a while now. But fuck that. I&#8217;m not going to even try. It&#8217;s gross. </p>

<p>Grind me up some lamb and cook it with carrots and peas and smother it with mashed potatoes. I&#8217;ll eat it all that way. I promise.</p>
