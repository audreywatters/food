<p>Here's what I'm expecting to pick up in the CSA this afternoon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fuyu Persimmons</li>
<li>Warren European Pears</li>
<li>Pink Lady Apples</li>
<li>Cameo Apples</li>
<li>Mangos</li>
<li>Pomegranates</li>
<li>Baby Red Romaine</li>
<li>Rosa Bianca Eggplant OR Mixed Summer Squash</li>
<li>Dino Kale</li>
<li>Tokyo Turnips</li>
<li>Acorn Squash</li>
<li>Braising Mix</li>
<li>Yukon Gold</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>Kin is out of town for the next few days, and I still have rapini and tokyo turnips from last week's CSA (as well as some eggs) to finish off. I'll broil the greens tonight and eat them with some <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020243-tofu-scramble">tofu</a>. I made a <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020778-baked-spanakopita-pasta-with-greens-and-feta">huge amount of pasta</a> last night, using up the arugula and kale from last week, which I'll be eating for the next few days as Kin's gone. That's fine. I'll pretend like it's carb-loading for my race on Saturday.</p>

<p>We're headed out of town next Thursday for another RV trip — just to the Russian River this time — so there won't be a CSA pickup next week. That's good, as it'll give me a chance to catch up on all the fruits and vegetables. I think I have plans for all the veggies, at least. But the fruits and the eggs require a little more thought. The freezer is already quite full of applesauce, so it might be time to start drinking juice again — particularly in another month or so when we start getting the citrus.</p>
