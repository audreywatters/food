<p>I made shepherd&#8217;s pie for dinner last night. </p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a cooking blog. I&#8217;m not going to share the recipe here. I didn&#8217;t take any photos as I saut√©ed the minced lamb with carrots and onion or sealed casserole dish with mashed potatoes.</p>

<p>Shepherd&#8217;s pie has been one my favorite foods for as long as I can remember. I have vague memories of being quite little and having family members mock me for asserting that that was my preference.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been terribly fond of meat. That&#8217;s a story for another day. But if you grind it up &#8211; pork or beef or lamb &#8211; it&#8217;s pretty tolerable. You aren&#8217;t confronted with the muscle or the fat in the same sort of way, either on your plate or in your mouth. </p>

<p>I decided to start writing down some of my thoughts and my memories about food because there are lots of issues I want to explore and unpack: my own tastes and habits but more broadly, some observations about how society interacts with food. I don&#8217;t really plan to start writing down recipes here &#8211; although I might. I&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of taking my wine drinking to a more serious, sommelier level. So I might use this as a space to list the adjectives that come to mind as I drink a glass or two or three. I might write about my family. I might write about other people&#8217;s families. I don&#8217;t know yet.</p>
