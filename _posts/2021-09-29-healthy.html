<p>I have been quite remiss in keeping this blog up-to-date, which is a shame considering &quot;food&quot; has been a major focus on my life lately. No doubt, I have put a lot of energy into what I cook and what I eat in order to distract me from my deep, deep grief at the loss of Isaiah. I also had a major health scare that led to the discovery of a (different) major health issue that prompted me to really re-evaluate what I'm doing with this aging body of mine. What I'm doing, more or less, is &quot;getting healthy&quot; — probably healthier than I've ever been in my life, which is weird to say at age 50. I've quit drinking — there's a lot to be written about that. I work out a lot — there's something to be written about that too, and although much of it is outside the purview of this blog, I do think a lot more now than I ever have before about what I eat, about my &quot;macros.&quot; </p>

<p>This last bit — particularly my efforts to get enough protein for my new powerlifting hobby (LOL, yes) — has had me looking for various recipes that will fulfill my insane hunger when I get home from the gym. While carbs seem to be very unpopular — keto whatever whatever — I'm not anti-carbs per se. I don't want to eat a lot of sugar though. And I don't want to eat too much fat. I don't want too much sodium. I would like a good amount of protein in my post-workout snack. So I've been baking muffins — &quot;healthy&quot; muffins — that I stir into a cup of Greek yogurt. And let me tell you, it's a hoot looking for &quot;healthy&quot; muffin recipes. </p>

<p>To be fair, looking for any sort of recipe content online is frustrating. The whole SEO game has forced food bloggers into a certain style of writing — I get that. Whatever. But when it comes to hitting those keywords like &quot;protein&quot; and &quot;healthy,&quot; particularly with something that's really just a heavy cupcake, the recipes are ludicrous. So I'm going to start chronicling my experiments baking &quot;healthy&quot; muffins. A batch of muffins is about 12; we won't eat that many in a week or even two. But I think I can do an update once a month or so with a recipe and some thoughts about what &quot;healthy&quot; means in its context. It'll be fun! And it won't be SEO-optimized as I don't want anyone to find this site. Yet.</p>
