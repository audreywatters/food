<p>It's CSA day! I'm not sure what Frog Hollow Farms will have in the box this week, but I hope it's more of the plums. They were so delicious that I made plum simple syrup and a plum almond cake — twice. </p>

<p>According to the email from River Dog Farms, these are the vegetables I'll pick up this afternoon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>Red Chard</li>
<li>Chioggia or Gold Beets</li>
<li>Napa Cabbage</li>
<li>Broccoli</li>
<li>Red Onion</li>
<li>Yukon Gold &amp; Purple Majesty Potatoes</li>
<li>Arugula</li>
</ul>

<p>The menu for this week:</p>

<ul>
<li>Today: Tempeh Banh Mi with Asian Coleslaw (this will use the cabbage)</li>
<li>Thursday: Greek Chicken with Cucumber-Feta Salad (this will use the oregano from last week's CSA)</li>
<li>Friday: Cod Cakes</li>
<li>Saturday: Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms and Morel-Miso Orzo</li>
<li>Sunday: Hamburgers, with White Bean and Roasted Potato Salad with Rosemary (This will use the potatoes and the chard)</li>
<li>Monday: White Pizza with Roasted Broccoli and Arugula Salad (This will use the broccoli and the arugula, obviously)</li>
<li>Tuesday: Sticky Chicken and White Rice with Roasted Carrots Salad (This will use some of the carrots)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll steam and freeze the beets — they're great in smoothies. The red onion will either end up in a meal or will be pickled this weekend. I'm also going to make some vegetable stock this weekend with a chicken carcass I have in the freezer (along with the tops and tails from vegetables — I just chuck things in a plastic bag and freeze them until I have enough to make stock.) I'm making some pumpkin spice superhero muffins with some yam puree I have had in the freezer for a while (so I guess they won't be pumpkin muffins), along with whatever fruits from the CSA work — possibly apricots?</p>

<p>I'm very pleased that all the fruit we got last week was used up: in crumbles, muffins, cakes, syrup, smoothies. Hopefully, we can do that again, particularly since Kaia gets home on Friday. (That is, hopefully she'll eat fruit, right?)</p>
