<p>I love kitchen gadgets and appliances. No matter the size of my kitchen, every drawer and cabinet will be full of them. I pulled the juicer our from the back of one this morning, so I could squeeze the rest of the citrus in the fruit basket before we picked up the CSA — and more citrus — this afternoon.</p>

<p>I've been interested in getting an air fryer for quite some time. But the Wirecutter review that I read a year or so ago said, &quot;hey, it's just a convection oven.&quot; And I knew I didn't have room on the counter for a convection oven. </p>

<p>I don't deep fry things that often — for health reasons, obviously, but also because it's such a mess. Inevitably, I want to do so and I realize I don't have enough canola oil to fill my Dutch oven adequately. I tend to crowd things in the pan, and then nothing's crisp and it's just disappointing and greasy.</p>

<p>But my Instant Pot died last month, and even though that too has been a bit of an unnecessary appliance purchase — I only use it as a pressure cooker — I decided to get a new one that came with an air fryer lid. I mean, if my cabinet is already crammed full with the Instant Pot, why not shove in another lid?!</p>

<p>I used it this past weekend to make fried chicken sandwiches — well, the fried chicken part, at least. And my god. It's a revelation. &quot;Think of all the things I can air fry!&quot; I said to Kin, listing off crab rangoon, egg rolls, and samosas to start. </p>

<p>I've become so accustomed to avoiding fried foods that I reckon it's going to take me a while to rethink my menus. But I'm going to keep experimenting with air frying — lugging this big pot in and out of the cupboard where it sits with all the other devices that, at the first successful meal-time, seemed like revelations too.</p>
