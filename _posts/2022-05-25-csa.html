<p>It's CSA day!</p>

<p>We subscribe to two CSAs: one vegetables, one fruits. We also get a dozen eggs each week from the former. It's slightly more than we can eat each week, and a lot of fruit goes into the freezer on Wednesday mornings, I admit. (But that gets used up eventually, over the winter months — in smoothies, muffins, and so on.)</p>

<p>This week's vegetable CSA includes one head of Napa cabbage, one bunch of carrots, one bunch of Tokyo turnips, one head of iceberg lettuce, two heads of red batavia lettuce, .66 lb of braising mix, one head of fennel, and one bunch of spring tornado. I have no idea what &quot;spring tornado&quot; is — Google is no help since the search string reveals storms, not vegetables.</p>

<p>Every Monday, Riverdog Farms emails me with the contents of the week's (vegetable) box. So every Monday night, I look at what I've planned to cook for the week and make adjustments based on what vegetables we'll have in the fridge. I'd planned to make a white pizza with caramelized onions and gruyere on Saturday; I'll use the fennel there in lieu of some of the onions. Next Tuesday's dinner is a sesame chicken meatball recipe from Ali Slagle's new cookbook I Dream of Dinner. Her recipe calls for broccoli. I'll use the cabbage instead. I'll serve the Tokyo turnips with the char sui bao I'm making Sunday. We'll eat the lettuce every night. I'll roast the carrots and eat them with my salad. I'm not sure what I'll do with the braising mix; I'm not sure what &quot;spring tornado&quot; is. When I get the box this afternoon, I'll have a better sense of the latter. The former might get steamed alongside the bratwurst I'm making on Saturday.</p>

<p>The fruit CSA — the famed Frog Hollow Farm — focuses on stone fruit this time of year. I'm expecting the box will have mulberries, cherries, apricots, peaches, blueberries, and avocados. Honestly, it's the avocados that I have the hardest time using. We're having fish tacos on Friday, so I'll make guacamole. The other fruits will go into smoothies. I'm making raspberry-zucchini cornbread superhero muffins on Saturday — I'll use mulberries for those. I'm making a &quot;snacking cake&quot; on Saturday too — I'll use the apricots and blueberries in that.</p>

<p>We're heading out of town on the 3rd of June so the CSA will be on pause next week and the week after. That'll give me some breathing room to use everything up that's in the fridge before we go. And freeze everything that doesn't get eaten.</p>

<p>A couple of notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I will get better at the format for this (weekly) post. I think I'll start posting my menu for the week too. And yeah, I should post some recipes</li>
<li>I have pictures of the box on my Instagram account</li>
