<p>According to the email from Riverdog Farms, here's what's in this week's CSA box:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.5 lbs Carrots</li>
<li>1 lb Red Beet</li>
<li>1 lb Mixed Squash</li>
<li>1 hd Green Cabbage</li>
<li>1 hd Fresh Torpedo</li>
<li>1.5 lbs Sifra Potatoes</li>
<li>4 ears Sweet Corn</li>
<li>1 bu Red Bor Kale</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm cooking for three people now that Kaia is with us for the summer, so we went through last week's CSA pretty quickly. (It means I'll have to buy lettuce at the grocery store, for starters.) </p>

<p>Here's the menu for the coming week:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wednesday: refried beans and homemade tortillas, and I'm turning that corn into elote. There's barely enough lettuce for salad tonight, but you gotta have something green on the table, so &quot;small side salad&quot; it is.</li>
<li>Thursday: I'm making a stewed chicken with dumplings recipe from <em>Simply Julia</em> — it will use up some of the carrots. It also has spinach (from the grocery store, not the CSA).</li>
<li>Friday: Friday is fish day, and I only have 12 ounces of salmon in the freezer, so I'm going to buy some frozen shrimp to expand the coconut-miso curry into a meal for four. (It also has spinach in it, which will also come from the grocery store — I shop on Friday afternoons, thankfully. That means we can also have salad, as I'll buy some lettuce). I have half a batch of breadstick dough in the freezer, so I'll whip up some breadsticks too.</li>
<li>Saturday: Ali Slagle has a great recipe for &quot;chicken with so much garlic&quot; in her cookbook <em>I Dream of Dinner</em> — I'm making that, and I'll sauté the kale on the side.</li>
<li>Sunday: I'm making a Vietnamese caramelized pork dish, and I'll use the cabbage for a stir fry.</li>
<li>Monday: I'm making falafel and pita (and hummus).</li>
<li>Tuesday: I'm trying a new recipe for peanut chicken curry, which calls for 4 cups of vegetables — perfect for the squash and the torpedo onions that are in the CSA.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm going to pickle the beets, but I'm not sure what I'll do with the potatoes. </p>

<p>I don't know what fruits will be in the Frog Hollow Farms CSA box — peaches, I'm guessing. I thought I saw the farm post on Instagram that apricot season is over — a pity, as they are so good. That said, I have about a dozen left that I'm going to freeze right now. I plan to turn some of the peaches into a syrup for Kin's &quot;special cocktails.&quot; And I will use whatever fruit we get in superhero muffins and snack cakes and smoothies.</p>
