<p>I put the CSA on pause this week, as I was feeling a little overwhelmed by the amount of fruit we still had to eat. Of course, now it's Wednesday, and I'll process the last few pieces of stone fruit and put them in the freezer. We'll be out of fruit; we're out of eggs.</p>

<p>Oh well. I'll grocery shop tomorrow, and I'll bake this weekend with something other than peaches.</p>

<p>The menu for the upcoming week looks something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wednesday — <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020778-baked-spanakopita-pasta-with-greens-and-feta">Baked Spanakopita Pasta with Greens and Feta</a></li>
<li>Thursday — <a href="https://amzn.to/3AJA8AW">Chicken Reuben Skillet</a> and <a href="https://www.mybakingaddiction.com/air-fryer-roasted-potatoes/">Air Fryer Fingerling Potatoes</a></li>
<li>Friday — <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020828-lemony-shrimp-and-bean-stew">Lemony Shrimp and Bean Stew</a> and <a href="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/homemade-olive-garden-breadsticks/">Breadsticks</a></li>
<li>Saturday — <a href="https://amzn.to/3TgDIty">Dumplings</a>, filled with Ground Pork and Chives</li>
<li>Sunday — Roasted Pork Tenderloin, Mashed Potatoes, and Steamed Broccoli</li>
<li>Monday — <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014140-shortcut-banh-mi-with-pickled-carrots-and-daikon">Banh Mi</a> and Sweet Potato Fries</li>
<li>Tuesday — <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020243-tofu-scramble">Tofu Scramble</a>, Roasted Breakfast Potatoes, and Flour Tortillas</li>
</ul>

<p>It's a very potato-heavy menu, I realize. <em>C'est la vie</em>.</p>
