<p>It's Wednesday, and this afternoon, I'll go pick up our CSA boxes: one box of vegetables from River Dog Farms, one dozen eggs — also from River Dog Farms, and a box of fruit from Frog Hollow Farms. Based on their emails, here's what I'm expecting:</p>

<ul>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>Oregano</li>
<li>Red Beets</li>
<li>Napa Cabbage</li>
<li>Red Russian Kale</li>
<li>Batavian Lettuce</li>
<li>Yukon Gold Potatoes</li>
<li>Arugula</li>
<li>Emeraude White Nectarines</li>
<li>Goshen Gold Apricots</li>
<li>Santa Rosa Plums</li>
<li>Flavorcrest Peaches OR Gold Dust Peaches</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>My freezer is already getting pretty full with the fruit that we aren't able to finish each week. Starting this weekend, I'll start turning some of the fruit into crumbles — those'll also go into the freezer, so it's not like I'll be saving any space. Kaia returns next Friday, so we will have another mouth to feed for the summer, so hopefully things'll get eaten. We've finished all the vegetables from last week, except for a bit of frisée, which I'll probably polish off at dinner, and the spinach, which I'll use in tomorrow's meal.</p>

<p>Kin has been out-of-town/out-for-dinner all week, so I have a lot of leftovers in the fridge. I'm not cooking anything for dinner tonight. We'll be going out for dinner on Friday too, as it's his birthday. But everything that's coming in today's vegetable box will be easily incorporated into upcoming meals. The meal plan looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wednesday: Leftovers (with salad)</li>
<li>Thursday: Green Curry Meatball Soup (with spinach from last week)</li>
<li>Friday: Eating out, but Kin's birthday cake will be an almond-plum cake</li>
<li>Saturday: Cheesy White Bean Tomato Bake (with the oregano from the CSA in the bake and on the garlic bread) and Salad; I'm also baking some Peach Cardamom Superhero Muffins and, as I said, making some fruit crumbles to put in the freezer</li>
<li>Sunday: Orange Beef and White Rice, with Spicy Stir-Fried Cabbage; I might test-drive the air-fryer and dehydrate some fruit, depending on how the day goes</li>
<li>Monday: Beans and Rice and Tortillas and Salad</li>
<li>Tuesday: Jalapeño-Popper-Stuffed Chicken and Mashed Potatoes and Salad</li>
<li>Wednesday: Tempeh Banh Mi and Salad</li>
<li>Thursday: Tahini Chicken Caesar Salad and Breadsticks (the former calls for kale as the base for the salad, but I'll see what next week's CSA looks like and what the kale looks like by then too. It might get sautéed earlier in the week)</li>
</ul>
