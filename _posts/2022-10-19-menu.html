<p>Here's what I'm expecting to pick up this afternoon:</p>

<ul>
<li>pears</li>
<li>apples</li>
<li>mangos</li>
<li>pomegranates</li>
<li>blueberries</li>
<li>eggs</li>
<li>braising mix</li>
<li>spaghetti squash</li>
<li>curly kale</li>
<li>chives</li>
<li>tokyo turnips</li>
<li>summer squash</li>
<li>yukon gold potatoes</li>
<li>arugula</li>
</ul>

<p>Much of the fruit will be made into syrups — I've had good success with that the last few weeks. The pears will be eaten in our morning smoothies; the apples will be used for baking. (I am making apple cider donuts this afternoon.) I was planning on making a bolognese on Saturday; now I'll serve it with spaghetti squash rather than homemade pasta. I'll steam the turnips for dinner tomorrow night — we're having teriyaki chicken. The potatoes will go into a jamaican curry. The kale and the braising mix will be side dishes in the comings days. The arugula will be eaten as salad. Bam. That's the menu. Or much of it, at least.</p>
