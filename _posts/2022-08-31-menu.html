<p>It's supposed to get very, very hot this weekend, so I've revised my menu plan somewhat so that I'm not using the oven as much. (I should note here that I plan every meal for the month so that I can make a big meat order from our butcher. I don't always follow this plan religiously — if you have a freezer full of chicken breasts, you do have some room to play…)</p>

<p>As we didn't pick up fruits or vegetables last week, the fridge has felt quite empty. But here's what I'll grab later this afternoon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Orange Honeydew</li>
<li>Painted Serpents</li>
<li>Sweet 100s</li>
<li>Red Slicers and Golden Jubilee</li>
<li>Sugar Cube Cantaloupe</li>
<li>Globe Eggplant</li>
<li>Emerald Beaut Plums</li>
<li>Autumn Bright Nectarines</li>
<li>Autumn Flame Peaches</li>
<li>Reed Avocados</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>Tomatoes. Cucumbers. Melons. Eggplant. All things Kin doesn't like. And with the impending heat wave, we'll be eating a lot of salad — ideal for this CSA box, but not his favorite. I'll probably use the melons in our morning smoothies, but I'll also make a fruit salad. I'm also making <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015843-charlie-birds-farro-salad">Charlie Bird's Farro Salad</a>, which is absolutely delicious and will use up the Sweet 100s, if nothing else. I'm making a <a href="https://www.nataliecooks.com/cooking-club-recipes/sheet-pan-tahini-chicken-caesar-salad">tahini chicken caesar salad</a> this weekend too, and I'll serve the cucumbers on the side with that.</p>

<p>I've been making the stone fruit into syrups for Kin's evening cocktails. But those Emerald Beaut Plums are so beautiful, I hate to do that. Kaia's birthday is coming up, and I'm going to make some <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/vanilla-bean-cheesecake-bars-recipe">vanilla bean cheesecake bars</a> for her, but I might make a <a href="https://emmaduckworthbakes.co.uk/plum-frangipane-tart/">plum frangipane</a> too if I have the time. (And if it's not too hot to do pastry.)</p>

<p>I'm hoping the avocado we get today isn't too firm, and we can eat it tonight as I'm making a big pot of cranberry beans and some corn muffins. The weather is supposed to get hotter and hotter as the week progresses, and I have Toad in the Hole scheduled for tomorrow night. I don't care how much we have to swelter: give me my chipolatas in yorkshire pud batter, thank you very much.</p>
