<p>I never really liked pie, mostly because I think the British hide horrible things in theirs, pretending like a nice flaky crust makes up for the fact that the filling is death. e.g. steak-and-kidney, mincemeat. How can you trust a pie? Answer: you can't unless, you make it yourself.</p>

<p>I wrote my Master's Thesis, in part, on pies. They make a great projectile. That does not change that they are a questionable foodstuff.</p>

<p>I've started baking pies lately -- mostly meat pies now that I can control what goes in. (No suet. No organs.) The key, in part, is that I've finally mastered making a good crust, although my crimping could use more work.</p>

<p>I've made a ground beef pie with a cheddar cheese crust. I've made chicken pot pie twice. I tried to make a curry chicken pie, but I didn't like the flavor of the curry much. </p>

<p>I made an apple pie too, despite always being in the camp that cake is better. The family is thrilled with this new obsession, not understanding why I've always loathed pies. Clearly they've never been served what my brother and I would call &quot;pee pie.&quot;</p>
