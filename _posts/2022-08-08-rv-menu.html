<p>We took the inaugural voyage in our new RV trailer this past weekend. I have a lot of thoughts I need to put into writing about the entirety of the trip — and about the new project Kin and I are starting: <a class="autolink" href="https://trails.contrafabulists.com">trails.contrafabulists.com</a>. But before I forget, I want to jot down what I cooked (and how I cooked) for this trip.</p>

<p><em>Mise En Place</em></p>

<p>Before leaving town, I did as much mise en place as possible, knowing that the countertop and prep space is really limited in the RV (and that I wouldn't have my nice knives with me). I stored all my chopped veggies in <a href="https://amzn.to/3bKkRGp">Stasher bags</a>. I'm really glad I did this as it made cooking much easier.</p>

<p><em>Thursday Night</em></p>

<p>We were late getting out-of-town (and hooked up, driving, and set up), and I should have thought of that before planning Thursday's meal. I thought I was being clever by packing the two <a href="https://parkersbritishinstitution.com/product/steak-ale-pie">steak-and-ale pies</a> my mom had sent Kin for his birthday — and indeed, they were delicious. But heating the oven and cooking pies for 30 minutes added a lot more time to the meal prep than we wanted at 7:30 or so at night (when we normally eat several hours earlier). I also brought new potatoes to boil and make mashed potatoes, along with a packet of brown gravy mix and lettuce for a salad. </p>

<p><em>Friday</em></p>

<p>I made pancakes for breakfast. I'd pre-made the dry mix, and so I just had to add the eggs, milk, and oil. I set off the fire alarm in the RV cooking these. Next time, I think, I'm going to do <a href="https://dinnerthendessert.com/sheet-pan-pancakes/">sheet-pan pancakes</a>, as it sucks to be flipping pancakes while the other person is already eating breakfast.</p>

<p>We typically eat fish for dinner on Fridays, and I'd first thought I'd make tuna casserole. But Kin hates tuna casserole, and so I made mac and cheese with chorizo and kale, topped with fried onions. I didn't prep the chorizo, and damn, yeah, my RV knives sucked. This was a good meal, despite using several pots for the sauce and the pasta (the kale cooked with the macaroni).</p>

<p>I made two microwaved &quot;mug cakes&quot; for dessert. This was a brilliant dessert, and I will bring along the ingredients for this each time. There are lots of ways to vary the flavors here — I had vanilla, and Kin had chocolate chip.</p>

<p><em>Saturday</em></p>

<p>I'd made bagel dogs ahead of time, and we ate these for lunch each day. Kin had the leftover pancakes for breakfast; I had sweet potato breakfast cookies — stellar — and yogurt and granola. These are all going in the regular repertoire.</p>

<p>I made drunken noodles Saturday night, and here was when I was particularly thankful to have done the <em>mise en place</em>. It turned out fine — I always think about Isaiah when I cook this as he'd complain my pad kee mao was woefully under-spiced. And this batch was woefully under-spiced, despite chopping up a jalapeño. That's fine though. It tasted okay (and I'm going to eat the leftovers for lunch today).</p>

<p>Saturday night's dessert was a mug cake with two peanut butter cups dropped in.</p>

<p><em>Sunday</em> </p>

<p>We had to check out of the campground by 11, so there was only really time for breakfast. Although we definitely could've eaten a bigger meal — we were so hungry by the time we got home at 3 that we went out for pizza immediately — cooking would probably interfere with tear down. So that's something to keep in mind for the next outing.</p>

<p>Overall, I packed the right amount of everything. We did bring home some leftovers. But the snacks got eaten. The cookies got eaten. We didn't go hungry, and I made good meals, even though this was all very new to me.</p>
