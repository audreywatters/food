<p>It's been a minute since I updated this site, as it's been a few weeks since I've picked up a CSA share. We've been traveling, which really shouldn't have stopped me from writing here. </p>

<p>I could have boasted about the success I had with the grill — a birthday gift from my mom. On our last RV trip — this time up to Arcata — I made hamburgers one night and pizza the next. I'll likely repeat these two meals on most of our outings. I took some leftovers for the first night on the road — that was also genius as it gave us time to get the RV all set up without my having to worry about dinner preparation. (Dinner preparation, in other words, was just nuking everything for a couple of minutes in the microwave.) </p>

<p>We're back out next weekend, so I won't pick up the CSA next week either. But today, I'm expecting the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pears</li>
<li>Apples</li>
<li>Mangos</li>
<li>Avocado</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Yellow Canary</li>
<li>Juliette Tomatoes</li>
<li>Early Girls</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Eggplant</li>
<li>Mixed Squash</li>
<li>French Fingerling Potatoes</li>
</ul>

<p>It'll be good to have some fresh fruits and vegetables in stock. It means, of course, that I'll have lots of food prep to do. I'm going to try to turn that melon into a syrup, for example. (I'm going to experiment with a cold press method rather than cooking down the melon. It won't can or keep for as long, but Kin goes through the syrup fairly quickly for his cocktails, so I'm not terribly concerned.)</p>

<p>Here's what the upcoming week's menu looks like:</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday</strong>: I'm cooking some of the Good Mother Hubbard beans from Rancho Gordo tonight, turning them into refried beans, along with Mexican rice and homemade tortillas. Here's hoping that the avocado in today's CSA is ripe enough to become guacamole.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday</strong>: I'm roasting some chicken thighs, along with some root vegetables in a gochuchang sauce. I'll serve this with white rice and salad.</p>

<p><strong>Friday</strong>: Friday means fish, and I've got some cod in the freezer. So I'll be beer-battering that, along with some homemade tartar sauce and fries. (The air fryer works will for this, and I'll use the fingerling potatoes from the CSA, I reckon.)</p>

<p><strong>Saturday</strong>: I'm going to try my hand at making potato knishes, which I'll serve with a miso-glazed eggplant (using the eggplant from the CSA). I'll use the mire poix miso from Shared Cultures for this. I'll also make the melon syrup and a batch of superhero muffins (probably using some of the apples from the CSA).</p>

<p><strong>Sunday</strong>: I'm making stuffed chicken with mustard greens, chèvre, and prosciutto — a recipe I got from an online cooking class taught by Elyse Kopecky. I'm also making a batch of sausage, egg, and cheese bao (from <em>Mooncakes and Milk Bread</em>) that'll go in the freezer, to be thawed on mornings Kin is out of bagels.</p>

<p><strong>Monday</strong>: I will have some leftover breakfast sausage from the bao, which I'll use in a breakfast casserole. This will use up the rest of the challah I made for Rosh Hashanah.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday</strong>: I'm trying another Ali Slagle recipe, because you really can't go wrong there: French Onion Mac and Cheese. This'll use up the rest of a French bread baguette I have in the freezer.</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday</strong>: I'm making pad Thai, along with Thai curried vegetables, the latter using up whatever vegetables haven't been used for the rest of the week.</p>

<p>There will be mangos and pears and tomatoes left over. The mangos will be made into smoothies — or perhaps into a syrup for Kin. The pears will be made into pear sauce and frozen. The tomatoes I'll eat with salads and possibly freeze. I wish Kin liked tomatoes more. I wish I liked tomatoes more. But summer is almost over, and I'll be missing the tomatoes until they reappear in 9 months or so in the CSA box.</p>
