<p>I put the CSA on &quot;pause&quot; last week as we were traveling. That's good — it gives me a chance to catch up on all the fruit and vegetables we have coming in. That said, the fridge is very bare, and I look forward to picking up the CSA this afternoon (and grocery shopping tomorrow).</p>

<p>I'm expecting the following fruits and vegetables in today's shares:</p>

<ul>
<li>eggs</li>
<li>honeydew</li>
<li>watermelon</li>
<li>grapes</li>
<li>tomatoes</li>
<li>cucumbers</li>
<li>summer squash</li>
<li>peaches</li>
<li>avocados</li>
<li>nectarines</li>
<li>pluots</li>
</ul>

<p>I can tell you right now that I'm having a Boichik Bagel on Saturday with a tomato and avocado. The rest of the avocado, tomato, and cucumbers will be sliced up for salads. The fruit will go into smoothies, galettes, muffins, and other baked goods. I'm making a bean primavera for dinner tonight that'll use some of the squash, but I'm thinking some might be grated for baking — I made zucchini brownies yesterday, and I'll certainly make them again. (The batch is almost gone!)</p>

<p>The menu for the week:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wednesday: White Bean Primavera and Garlic Knots</li>
<li>Thursday: Halal Cart-Style Chicken and Rice with White Sauce and Pita Bread</li>
<li>Friday: Gochugaru Salmon with Crispy Rice</li>
<li>Saturday: Mushroom Mushroom Bao</li>
<li>Sunday: Beef Pie with Cheddar Cheese Crust</li>
<li>Monday: Turmeric Black Pepper Tempeh</li>
<li>Tuesday: Rasta Pasta with Jerk Chicken</li>
<li>Wednesday: Beans and Rice (damn, the next Rancho Gordo shipment is on its way and I haven't touched the lima beans)</li>
</ul>

<p>This week's menu wasn't really made with the CSA in mind, which is good as they're mostly fruits. That means I'll just stock up on onions, carrots, lettuce, and bell peppers at the grocery store, I guess.</p>
