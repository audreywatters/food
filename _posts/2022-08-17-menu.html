<p>I still have three peaches leftover from last week, and it looks like we'll get more peaches today. I think I'll make a <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021204-peach-poundcake">peach poundcake</a> (although I'm sure I'll make some galettes in the coming days too).</p>

<p>As it's the height of summer, even the vegetable CSA is full of fruit this week: melon, tomatoes, cucumbers, squash. Kin doesn't really like any of those, which definitely hampers my ability to cook with them. But that's ok. I'm perfectly happy to eat my weight in tomato sandwiches for the next few weeks, because I won't eat tomatoes again until next summer.</p>

<p>The Riverdog Farms CSA box should look something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 pc Charlyn</li>
<li>2 pc Painted Serpents</li>
<li>1 pt Sweet 100s</li>
<li>1 lb Early Girl Tomatoes</li>
<li>1.5 pcs French Fingerling</li>
<li>1 lb Mixed Summer Squash</li>
<li>0.75 Red Onion</li>
</ul>

<p>And Frog Hollow Farms says I'm getting peaches, nectarines, pluots, and grapes.</p>

<p>My birthday is Saturday, so we're eating out that night. But the menu otherwise looks something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wednesday — Beans and Rice — the next quarterly shipment of the Rancho Gordo Bean Club is on its way, and I'm quite pleased with how well we've eaten our way through our bean supply. I still have the lima beans, but really that's it. The last of the vaquero beans are being eaten tonight. I'll serve this with the rest of that giant avocado from last week's fruit box, as well as tomatoes and cucumbers. There are pickled onions and lettuce (purchased from Target!) and roast carrots, salad-wise.</li>
<li>Thursday — I'm making <a href="https://www.nataliecooks.com">Natalie Cooks</a>' curried chicken and rice, which uses three cups of chopped vegetables — so the summer squash will go into that, along with the last three carrots that are in the fridge (and possibly some onion). Salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. I'll make the peach poundcake.</li>
<li>Friday — Friday is fish day, and I'm making blackened rockfish tacos, with refried beans (see above re: the bean club. This'll be the last of the pintos). Salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.</li>
<li>Saturday — we're eating out at Wapehpah's Kitchen, which I'm so excited about. I've glanced at the menu, and I think I'll get the rabbit tamales. Mmmm. I have an abundance of superhero muffins in the freezer, so I don't think I'll make muffins this weekend, so I can use everything up.</li>
<li>Sunday — it's a big bao day. I'm making sausage, egg, and cheese bao — I'll freeze these and folks can cook them for their breakfasts. I'm also making fried chicken and bao for dinner. I'll pickle some cucumber to serve with this. And ya know, salad.</li>
<li>Monday — This will be the last of the chickpeas: harissa chickpeas and feta. It's a great recipe from Ali Slagle's <em>I Dream of Dinner</em>. I might sneak some of the tomatoes into this — the recipe just called for tomato paste. We'll see. I'll get Kin to help make pita. And salad.</li>
<li>Tuesday — Cashew chicken and rice. And salad.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fruits will become galettes, syrups, and smoothies.</p>
