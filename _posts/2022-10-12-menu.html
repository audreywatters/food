<p>It's CSA day, and according to the email from Riverdog Farm and according to Frog Hollow Farm's blog, I'll be picking up the following this afternoon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Green Beans</li>
<li>Cherry Tomatoes</li>
<li>Dino Kale</li>
<li>Parsley</li>
<li>Globe or Rosa Bianca Eggplant</li>
<li>Mixed Squash</li>
<li>Toyko Turnips</li>
<li>Acorn Squash</li>
<li>Pears</li>
<li>Apples</li>
<li>Dragonfruit</li>
<li>Blueberries</li>
<li>Avocado</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>This certainly calls for a ratatouille, which I'll make this weekend — that'll use up the tomatoes, the eggplant, and the squash. I'll also roast, puree, and freeze the squash and boil, puree, and freeze the pears and apples this weekend. (Although some of the latter might be turned into a cake. We'll see.) Both the blueberries and the dragonfruit will be turned into syrup — another chore for this weekend. We'll eat the green beans tonight with shepherd's pie. We'll eat the turnips tomorrow with the sesame chicken and noodles. We'll eat the kale on Friday, along with the homemade pasta I'm planning on making. </p>

<p>I've prepped my grocery list, and I seem to be making a lot of things with eggs in the next few days, so even though I've got half a dozen in the fridge and I'm picking up a dozen this afternoon, I think I'll still need to buy a dozen more tomorrow. (I'm making the last superhero muffin recipe I've yet to try this weekend, and it calls for 10 eggs. Holy shit.)</p>

<p>This past weekend, we were out in the RV, and I made another round of burgers and pizza on the grill. I made pancakes again too. All very successful, and it's going to be hard to break out of this very good rut. However, in December, we'll be taking a much longer trip and I think I'll have to bring along more canned and boxed foods — think spaghetti and spaghetti sauce, canned beans and the like. I need to write a post detailing some of my thoughts on cooking in the RV (like <em>in</em> the RV and alongside it, on the grill). But I suppose I need to get a bit more experience doing so under my belt.</p>
