<p>Next week marks a significant change in this household's food habits, as Kaia leaves to return to college. It's her birthday today and we're dining out tonight at a Korean restaurant in The City. We'll eat out on Saturday at the Chuseok Festival and possibly on Sunday, her last night here. </p>

<p>I have a cheesecake in the oven for her birthday. It's been much too hot to cook or bake, and I'm already regretting turning the oven on as I'm typing this at the kitchen table and it's hot in here.</p>

<p>Here's what I'll pick up in the CSA boxes this afternoon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Orange Honeydew</li>
<li>Lemon Cucumbers</li>
<li>Sweet 100s</li>
<li>Mixed Heirloom &amp; Early Girl</li>
<li>Green Beans</li>
<li>Green Zucchini</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Peaches</li>
<li>Plums</li>
<li>Avocados</li>
<li>Pears</li>
</ul>

<p>I still have one cucumber left in the fridge from last week â€” the painted serpents were longer than my arm. And I froze two tomatoes, which is heartbreaking, but they'll definitely get used up this winter. </p>

<p>It's too hot to think about how I'll cook with these. &quot;Salads&quot; is all that I can say right now (even though the heatwave is supposed to end on Thursday or Friday).</p>
