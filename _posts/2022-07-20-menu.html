<p>This past weekend, Kin and I bought an RV trailer. I immediately googled &quot;RV trailer cookbooks&quot; and was sort of appalled at the options. I mean, okay, there's a balance to be struck between opening up a can of whatever and heating it up on the little stovetop and constructing some elaborate meal to enjoy in the depths of the forest. But still. I don't need a cookbook to tell me how to make scrambled eggs; nor do I need one that tells me how to make a 16-ingredient frittata oven an open flame. So it's a new challenge for me, no doubt: figure out the best (&quot;healthy,&quot; right?) meals — minimal <em>mise en place</em>, minimal grease and smoke — to make in my new tiny kitchen.</p>

<p>I'm not sure when we will actually pick the trailer up — we have to have a hitch installed on the car and have an educational walkthrough on how-to-RV. And then we have to plot our next getaway. We were supposed to head up to Arcata next week, but I've canceled our hotel room. We'll head north in the new digs. (We named our car &quot;Kiefer.&quot; I suggested &quot;Julia&quot; as the name for the RV — a nod to Julia Child, but realized that Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland were in <em>Flatliners</em> which isn't exactly what I want to invoke.)</p>

<p>Anyway. This week. This week, the vegetables in the River Dog Farm CSA will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 pc Sensation Melon</li>
<li>3 pcs Sweet Corn</li>
<li>1 lb Mixed Squash</li>
<li>1.25 lb Early Girl Tomatoes</li>
<li>2 pcs Red Onion</li>
<li>1 lb German Butterball</li>
<li>1 pc Green Cabbage</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll get a dozen eggs as well, and then from Frog Hollow Farm, we'll get pluots, nectarines, and peaches again.</p>

<p>And the week's menu goes something a little like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wednesday — I'm making refried beans and homemade tortillas for dinner tonight; we'll eat a salad as well and probably finish off some of the breakfast potatoes I made a few days ago</li>
<li>Thursday — I made some pesto over the weekend using edamame and arugula. I'll serve this with gnocchi, homemade french bread, and some of those lovely early girl tomatoes. Also salad.</li>
<li>Friday — Fish and chips. Well, fish and breakfast potatoes. And salad. I'll also make an almond-plum cake.</li>
<li>Saturday — I think we're going out for dinner, as Kin's sister and her son and partner will be in town for an A's game. If not, I'm making a vegetable stromboli, using up those summer squash. And, of course, salad.</li>
<li>Sunday — I'm making jalapeño popper-stuffed chicken Mexican rice, and sweet corn. And salad.</li>
<li>Monday — I'm trying the Greek Bison Burger recipe from <em>Run Fast, Eat Slow</em>, and again some breakfast potatoes. And salad.</li>
<li>Tuesday — I love the cheesy white bean tomato bake from The NYT Cooking. (I think it's an Ali Slagle recipe). I'll thaw out the other loaf of gochujang sourdough to serve with it. And if we haven't eaten the cabbage or the squash, I'll probably sauté it as a side dish.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fruit will be turned into smoothies, cakes, and my new love, galettes.</p>
