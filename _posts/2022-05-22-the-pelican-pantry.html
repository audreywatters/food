<p>Welcome to The Pelican Pantry â€” part food memoir, part recipe book, part eating guide, part "healthy food" criticism, part pantry management tips, part grocery politics, part "what the hell do I do with 2 pounds of daikon radish in this week's CSA?!" brainstorming. In other words, I'm not quite sure what this site is going to do or be quite yet. But like the pelican, I'm going to just toss it all into this pouch and sift through it later. (Okay, that's not exactly how a pelican's pouch works, but let's just roll with the analogy.)</p>
