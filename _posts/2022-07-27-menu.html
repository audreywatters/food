<p>I'm not sure what happened this past week, but I seem to have a lot of vegetables leftover. (I know what happened: we ate out on Saturday night.) I'll use a fair number of them in tonight's dinner — a Japanese curry. But today is CSA day, so I'm feeling quite challenged to use everything before it goes bad. (I can freeze things, sure. I can make vegetable stock, I suppose. But those are both last resorts.) There's also fruit leftover too, although once I finish typing this up, I'm going to make a galette — something that I've done fairly frequently since I found <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016758-fruit-galette">this recipe by Melissa Clark</a>.</p>

<p>The Riverdog Farm box contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 pc Charentais Melon</li>
<li>4 pcs Sweet Corn</li>
<li>1 bu Basil</li>
<li>1.25 lb Early Girl Tomatoes</li>
<li>2 pcs Slicing Cucumber</li>
<li>1 lb Green Beans</li>
<li>1 doz Eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>The Fox Hollow Farm box contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>Peaches</li>
<li>Nectarines</li>
<li>Pluots</li>
</ul>

<p>The menu for the week looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wednesday: Japanese curry and rice — this will use up the squash from last week, as well as some carrots</li>
<li>Thursday: Stromboli — I'm not sure what vegetables I'll put in this, but I'll stick some of the basil in there, probably</li>
<li>Friday — Jerk Salmon, spicy mashed sweet potatoes, and mango slaw — I'll use up last week's cabbage in the slaw</li>
<li>Saturday — Creamy cashew udon with crispy mushrooms and steamed green beans — the green beans, obviously, will be eaten here</li>
<li>Sunday — Xi'an Style Braised Lamb Ro Jia Mao — another recipe from <em>Milk Bread and Mooncakes</em>, which I'll serve with sweet corn on the side</li>
<li>Monday — High-altitude Bison Meatballs with Simple Marinara — this recipe is from <em>Run Fast, Eat Slow</em>, and I'll use some of the tomatoes and the basil in the marinara</li>
<li>Tuesday — <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018299-weeknight-fancy-chicken-and-rice">Weeknight Fancy Chicken and Rice</a> — I haven't tried this recipe before; it's another one from my go-to, NYT Cooking</li>
<li>Wednesday — <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020705-cheesy-spicy-black-bean-bake">Cheesy, Spicy Black Bean Bake</a> — yup, another NYT recipe, this one from one of my favorite recipe authors, Ali Slagle. I'm also making some bagel dogs to take on our road trip, using a jalapeño-cheddar sourdough. We'll see how that turns out. And I'll make some sweet potato breakfast cookies from <em>Rise and Run</em> as well</li>
</ul>

<p>We won't get CSA boxes next week as we're heading out of town. I guess that'll give me a chance to catch up on eating all this bountiful fruit and veggies!</p>
