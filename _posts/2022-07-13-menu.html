<p>I'm on my own today — Kin is out of town until Friday and Kaia is up in Eugene visiting her mom and won't be back for 10 days. So the CSA is going to overwhelm me, I reckon. Here's what I'm expecting:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 lbs Carrots</li>
<li>3 pcs Yolo Yolo Sweets</li>
<li>1 lb Mixed Squash</li>
<li>2 pcs Slicing Cucumbers</li>
<li>1 bu Basil</li>
<li>1.5 lbs Purple Majesty</li>
<li>1 bu Pink Chard</li>
<li>0.75 lb Green Beans</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll also get a dozen eggs and nectarines, pluots, and peaches.</p>

<p>And here's what's on the menu: leftovers, heh. That is, I'll eat up what's in the fridge until Saturday, when I'm planning on making fried chicken sandwiches, along with home fries with some of the potatoes (from this week and last). The cucumber will be used in Sunday's meal: Korean barbecue-style meatballs. I'm making orange chicken and rice bowls on Monday and the recipe calls for &quot;4 cups of chopped veggies&quot; — so that'll use up the squash and beans. Tuesday night, I'm making sweet and spicy tofu with soba noodles, and I'll sauté the chard. Wednesday night, I'm making refried beans and tortillas. And Thursday — I think the first meal when Kaia returns — I'm making gnocchi with an edamame pesto. I never worry about using up carrots - they always seem to get eaten.</p>

<p>Fruitwise: I'm planning on making a frangipane tart this weekend with the pluots. I'll use the peaches in more of the peach syrup I made last weekend. I bought some small jars, and I'm going to try canning this batch. The stone fruit will also go in my weekly batch of superhero muffins, as well as into my daily smoothies. I'm going to start drinking the latter twice a day, as I'm working to build up my running miles in anticipation of half-marathon training. More calories. Yay! And damn, I do love summer fruits for getting me there.</p>
