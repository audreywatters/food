<p>I've started tracking the common ingredients for muffins, along with their nutritional content. This is still very much a work-in-progress, but I thought I'd quickly through up a page that displays the database. My goals are to be able to quickly gauge the protein/sugar/fat/etc content of an ingredient so I can make decent substitutions. (I'm also really interested in claims about "healthy" recipes that contain different kinds of high-fat fats and high-sugar sugars â€” that's another post for another day.)</p>
