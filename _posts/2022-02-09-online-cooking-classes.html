<p>I am taking a lot of online classes right now — as one does, I suppose, in the middle (the end?) of a pandemic; as one does, I suppose, when one is weighing a major career change. Most of these pertain to health and wellness in some way, and on Sunday, I took my first cooking class. Well, my first <em>online</em> cooking class — when I was younger, I took a class in cake decorating at a local bakery. It was tremendous fun, and I wish I'd maintained the skills. (I rarely frost anything anymore, let alone use a fancy piping bag and nozzle.) </p>

<p>Sunday's class was with Elyse Kopecky, whose cookbooks I adore and whose recipes for superhero muffins have changed my world — my pre-and post-workout meal world, at least. The menu she devised for us to make was great — a mustard-greens-and-chevre stuffed chicken breast, a roast carrot salad, edamame pesto, and the most incredible brownies for dessert. I really love her style of cooking — it's not fussy. She doesn't avoid fats. She uses a lot of vegetables. Everything was so delicious, and I'll riff off of many of the items from here on out — particularly these spicy seed clusters we made for the salad.</p>

<p>As I weigh making a change to what I do professionally, I do think about the role that &quot;online education&quot; plays in all these things, and I wonder if that's going to be the bridge for me to get from here to there. But with all I've invested in <em>criticism</em>, it's hard for me to just move into a new sphere and turn off that part of my brain — what I know works for teaching and learning in a digital space. And I want to get out of the digital space, truth be told. That's one of the things I love about cooking — it's embodied. Eating is embodied too. </p>

<p>What makes a good online cooking class though? I am going to take a couple of different knife skills classes — something I know I need to work on. (And I'm signed up for another of Elyse's classes too.) What are the limits of online when it comes to health/wellness/fitness education? Do I have any specific skills and knowledge that will help me (help others) in a new career?</p>
