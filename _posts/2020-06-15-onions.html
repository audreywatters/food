<p>I'd have him chop the onions and garlic for me. He was so much more fastidious than me. I don't mind if they're all different sizes. I try to accomplish the prep work for meal quickly. He would spend so long, making sure everything was diced, not chopped, and uniformly so.</p>

<p>I will think of him every day, and I will have real reasons now to cry quietly as I chop the onions.</p>
