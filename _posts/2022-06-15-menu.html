<p>I'm still getting into the rhythm of posting these updates. We went out of town for a week, and as such, skipped two weeks of CSA pick-up. I have several stories I want to write about what we ate while on the road - breakfast burritos, anyone? - but for now, let's look forward to what's in this week's CSA, which I will go pick up in a couple of hours:</p>

<p>Vegetable Box:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1 lb apricots</li>
	<li>1 bunch carrots</li>
	<li>1 head fennel</li>
	<li>1 lb yellow finn potatoes</li>
	<li>1 bunch spinach</li>
	<li>.75 lb little gem lettuce</li>
	<li>1 head frisee</li>
	<li>1 lb broccoli</li>
</ul>

<p>Fruit Box:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Peaches</li>
	<li>Apriums</li>
	<li>Apricots</li>
	<li>Plums</li>
	<li>Nectarines</li>
</ul>

<p>The Plan:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Apricots: Apricot Crisp Bars (with weed butter), Ultimate Superhero Muffins</li>
	<li>Fennel and potatoes: Roasted</li>
	<li>Lettuce and frisee: Salads</li>
	<li>Broccoli: Roasted, for salads</li>
	<li>Spinach: Green Curry Meatball Soup on Thursday</li>
	<li>Carrots: Ultimate Superhero Muffins, as well as Carrot and Chickpea Korma</li>
	<li>Nectarines: Nectarine and Cornmeal Upside-Down Cake</li>
	<li>Peaches: Smoothies</li>
</ul>
