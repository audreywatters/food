          <p>I made quiche for breakfast yesterday. I'd baked a ham the night before, and there were leftovers. I also had plenty of eggs in the fridge, as well as a decent supply of pastry flour.</p>

<p><em>"Damn, this is the best quiche I've ever eaten" -- my husband</em></p>

<p>I've never been a huge fan of pies in any form, partly because I've long struggled to make a decent pie crust. I could say that the pastry flour — a purchase from our local bakery, which now sells all sorts of baking supplies as well as some delicious breads — has helped improve my crusts. But I've only made a couple of things since I got the flour, and I've been honing my crust-making skills for a while now. Chicken pot pie. Ground beef sky with a cheddar crust. That sort of thing.</p>

<p>There were a bunch of apples in our weekly fruit CSA, so I made a bunch of hand-pies to freeze. The crusts on them were damn near perfect. So I used that recipe to make the quiche. It was a touch sweet, if I'm honest. But god, it was so light. And the filling turned out well too — I've overcooked a quiche before trying to ensure that it's set. This one had Swiss cheese on the bottom, then a cup of ham and a couple of tablespoons of green onions, then the egg filling, and then cheddar on top. It was beautiful. I just had two slices for lunch today.</p>

<p>I should probably eat less. I'm not exercising at all under these stay-at-home orders. But then I'd have to cook less. And cooking is one of the things that gives my life shape and rhythm right now. </p>
