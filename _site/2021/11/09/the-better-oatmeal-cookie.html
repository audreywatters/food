          <p>Whenever I ask Kin what kind of cookies he'd like me to bake, he reminds me of how he ranks his favorites: peanut butter are okay; chocolate chips are good; better are my molasses cookies; and the best are oatmeal.</p>

<p>I found a pretty good oatmeal cookie recipe online a while ago. (<em><a href="#recipe">Jump to the Recipes</a></em>) It makes a soft cookie — a necessity — but it's just too sweet for me. Kin loves it, and to be honest, when I bake cookies they're really to fit his taste-buds. But <a href="http://food.audreywatters.com/2021/10/19/the-better-peanut-butter-cookie">after trying the miso-peanut butter cookies</a> a few weeks ago, I thought I'd see if I could make a batch of oatmeal cookies that were less sweet, with the umami that miso adds.</p>

<p>I feel quite validated about using miso in my baking, incidentally, particularly after Crystelle, a contestant in this season's <em>Great British Bake Off</em> incorporated it into a couple of her caramel contributions this past week. &quot;It's like salted caramel,&quot; she explained to the skeptical judges. &quot;YES!&quot; I shouted at the television. (She won Baker of the Week too, I might add.)</p>

<p>I probably should have just modified my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe to make it &quot;healthier,&quot; but instead I googled the whole &quot;healthy oatmeal cookie&quot; thing and opted to try one with far less sugar. And as I've never actually baked this recipe before <em>without</em> miso, it's hard to judge fully how the addition of that ingredient affected the texture and taste. </p>




<p><h2 id="recipe">Soft Oatmeal Cookies</h2></p>

<p><em>This is based on the recipe that appears on the <a href="https://sugarspunrun.com/big-soft-oatmeal-cookies/#recipe">Sugar Spun Run</a> blog.</em></p>

<p style="font-size:18px">Prep time: 40 minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooking time: 10 minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;Servings: 34&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;Calories: 116</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>

	<li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>

	<li>1 cup brown sugar</li>

	<li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>

	<li>2 eggs</li>

	<li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>

	<li>1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>

	<li>2 tsp cornstarch</li>

	<li>1 tsp baking soda</li>

	<li>3/4 tsp salt</li>

	<li>3/4 tsp cinnamon</li>

	<li>3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<ol>

	<li>Using a stand mixer, cream the butter and sugars.</li>

	<li>Add eggs, one at a time, beating until combined. Then add in the vanilla extract.</li>

	<li>In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.</li>

	<li>Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture until completely combined.</li>

	<li>Stir in oats.</li>

	<li>Chill dough in refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>

	<li>Preheat oven to 375 and line cookies sheets with parchment paper.</li>

	<li>Drop cookie dough by rounded 2 tablespoon-fulls onto the parchment paper -- about a dozen per sheet. (These will spread slightly.)</li>

	<li>Bake for 10 minutes. They will look underbaked, but will finish cooking on the cookie sheet as they cool.</li>

	<li>Allow cookies to cool completely on cookie sheet.</li>

</ol>




<p><h2>Not-So-Sweet Miso Oatmeal Cookies</h2></p>

<p><em>This is based on the recipe that appears on the <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/healthy-oatmeal-cookies/">Well Plated</a> website.</em></p>

<p style="font-size:18px">Prep time: 40 minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooking time: 10 minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;Servings: 24&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;Calories: 73</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>

	<li>1 1/4 cup quick oats</li>

	<li>1 cup white whole wheat flour</li>

	<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>

	<li>1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce</li>

	<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>

	<li>2 tbs white miso</li>

	<li>1 egg</li>

	<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>

	<li>7 tbs honey</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<ol>

	<li>In a large bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.</li>

	<li>In a medium bowl, combine the applesauce, melted butter, miso, egg, vanilla, and honey. Whisk until blended.</li>

	<li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and stir just until combined. The dough will be very wet and sticky. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>

	<li>Preheat oven to 350.</li>

	<li>Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper.</li>

	<li>Drop 1.5 tablespoon size balls of dough onto cookie sheet - one dozen will fit per sheet. This dough will not spread, so flatten the balls slightly.</li>

	<li>Bake for 9 to 10 minutes.</li>

	<li>Cool on the cookie sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

</ol>

<p><h2>Some Baking and Tasting Notes</h2></p>

<p>The "healthy" cookies were smaller, and as such, it's a bit silly to make too much out of a calorie comparison. <a href="http://food.audreywatters.com/2021/10/06/what-is-a-healthy-muffin">That word "healthy" is a tricky one in any baked good</a>. I mean, yes, there was less sugar and less fat. "Healthy" though? Hmm.</p>

<p>I used one tablespoon less honey and one tablespoon less butter than the original recipe, adding in two tablespoons of miso. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee. But I wish I'd used old fashioned rolled oats rather than the quick oats that the original suggested. That made them very soft and almost cake-like, and I think the texture that old fashioned oats provides is much better, much... well... oatier. Interestingly, these cookies stayed soft for a long time - is that a result of the fermentation from the miso? I don't know. The peanut butter-miso cookies held their softness as well. (I'm not sure how I'd find the answer here.)</p>

<p>All-in-all, I think I'll stick with making the first recipe when baking oatmeal cookies for Kin. But my experimentation with miso - in cookies and otherwise - will continue...</p>
