        <title>The Better Molasses Cookie Recipe</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My molasses cookies are Kin's favorite. And I'll admit, they're one of my favorites as well. There's something about that ginger-molasses combination that just hits perfectly. The recipe I use makes a nice soft cookie — one that doesn't dry out on the counter and turn into more of a ginger snap. (Admittedly, these don't last that long.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I've been looking for &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; cookie recipes, I thought I'd take my current recipe head-to-head with a molasses cookie variation. I chose The New York Times Cooking's chocolate-molasses cookie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read the recipe, I knew it would be an unfair comparison. It has fresh grated ginger! Why aren't I adding fresh grated ginger to my usual recipe!? (I think I will from now on.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm getting ahead of myself…&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;recipe&quot;&gt;Molasses Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is based on the recipe that appears on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesaltymarshmallow.com/old-fashioned-soft-molasses-cookies/#recipe&quot;&gt;Salty Marshmallow&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px&quot;&gt;Prep time: 10 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooking time: 15 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Servings: 31&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Calories: 127&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 cup brown sugar&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 cup butter, softened&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup molasses&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tsp vanilla&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 1/2 cups flour&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 tsp baking soda&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 1/2 tsp cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 1/2 tsp ginger&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 tsp salt&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup granulated sugar (for decoration)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 325 degrees.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, butter, egg, molasses, and vanilla.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a large bowl, combine the flour, soda, salt, and spices. Add the wet ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Roll into tablespoon-size balls, then roll in sugar. Place on a baking sheet -- about a dozen fit on a sheet.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Bake for 13-15 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Cool on a wire rack.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chocolate Molasses Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is based on Alison Roman's recipe in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019806-chocolate-molasses-cookies&quot;&gt;The New York Times Cooking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px&quot;&gt;Prep time: 40 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooking time: 10 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Servings: 33&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Calories: 75&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup unsalted butter&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tbs freshly grated ginger&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 1/2 cups flour&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup cocoa powder&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 tsp baking soda&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tsp cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tsp ginger&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tsp salt&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/3 cup granulated sugar (plus extra for decoration)&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup molasses&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 350 degrees.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a small pot over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the fresh ginger. Remove from heat and let cool while you prepare everything else.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a large bowl, combine the flour, spices, soda, and salt.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, molasses, egg, and ginger/butter. Slowly mix into the dry ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;The dough will be very soft, so refrigerate for about 15 minutes to firm. Then roll into small balls, about the size of a quarter. Roll in sugar, and place on cookie sheet -- about a dozen per sheet.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Bake for 6-8 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Cool on on a wire rack.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some Baking Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;plain&amp;quot; molasses cookie is, as I said, pretty close to perfect — it's soft, with that granulated sugar texture. The chocolate version bakes at a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time. That's not the only reason they're &amp;quot;fudgier,&amp;quot; of course. But it doesn't have that same molasses cookie texture at all. The chocolate, however, gives it such a rich, dark taste. Despite the addition of the fresh ginger, the ginger flavor didn't overpower the chocolate. And wow damn, I love these. Kin did too, although he's requested I stick with my original recipe for future bakes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Muffin Fats</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Great Muffin Experiment, No. 6&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;#recipe&quot;&gt;Jump to the Recipe&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my goals with this muffin experiment was to do just that: experiment with different ingredients in order to optimize the health benefits in my daily post-workout snack. As I've written before, I'm not actively avoiding fats, but I am keenly interested in consuming &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; fats and getting the most bang-for-the-buck out of the fats I eat. That means that recipes that call for vegetable oil are easy targets for revision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before you revise any recipe, I'd argue, you have to understand why they contain oil in the first place — this is key to all substitutions. If you just say &amp;quot;to hell with it, I'm leaving out the butter altogether in this pound cake,&amp;quot; you're going to be sorely disappointed with the &amp;quot;cake&amp;quot; you bake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does fat do in a muffin? It slows down the gluten formation caused by the chemical reactions from baking soda and powder — I really need to write about these two ingredients in a future post. As such, oil makes the baked good fluffy and moist. When switching out the oil for a different ingredient, you have to think about both the properties of the oil &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the substitute so that texture and flavor aren't adversely impacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's just say that when recipes say &amp;quot;vegetable oil,&amp;quot; they mean &amp;quot;canola,&amp;quot; even though oil can be made from a ton of grains and fruits and vegetables. Indeed, one of the easiest ways to improve the healthiness of one's cooking is to use better oils: say, olive oil or avocado or coconut. These are high in antioxidants and monounsaturated fat — the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; kind of fat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could also use nut butters in lieu of oil. The recipe below does just that, using peanut butter in lieu of the avocado in the original (and already very healthy) recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dairy products can also work instead of oil: butter (I mean, sure, why not — there are fewer calories in a tablespoon of butter than in a tablespoon of canola oil, after all), sour cream, yogurt, kefir, buttermilk. These can all work. Is mayonnaise a dairy product? Not sure, to be honest. But as mayo is part oil already, it can be used quite successfully. (I don't think you'll get much of a health boost for this switch, but sometimes you're out of oil and want to make brownies. I get it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common, &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; oil substitute is probably applesauce. But really, almost any fruit or vegetable will work the same way — substitute pureed fruit for the same amount of oil. Bananas. Apples. Pears. Pumpkin. Sweet potato. Beets. Zucchini. Depending on the fruit or vegetable, this will change the taste and appearance of the baked good. And it'll often make the crumb more dense — so you might substitute just half the oil, perhaps, for applesauce. That's still a substantial reduction in fat and calories. It will, on the other hand, increase the carbohydrates in your recipe. (For what it's worth, a cup of pumpkin puree has fewer calories, less sugar, and more protein than applesauce. And you can make a puree out of any winter squash, not just pie pumpkins.)&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;recipe&quot;&gt;Chickpea Banana Peanut Butter Muffins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is based on the recipe for no sugar added chickpea banana muffins on &lt;a href=&quot;https://kellyjonesnutrition.com/no-added-sugar-chickpea-banana-muffins/&quot;&gt;Kelly Jones Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px&quot;&gt;Prep time: 10 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooking time: 20 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Servings: 16&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Calories: 91&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 1/2 cup chickpea flour&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tsp baking soda&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 tsp baking powder&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 tsp salt&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tsp cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;3 ripe bananas&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 tbs applesauce&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup peanut butter&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tbs vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;3 tbs oat milk&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 1/2 tbs apple cider vinegar&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 350 and line muffin tins with paper liners.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a medium bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients (flour, baking soda and powder, salt, and cinnamon).&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a large bowl, combine the wet ingredients (bananas, applesauce, peanut butter, eggs, vanilla, and vinegar). Whisk until blended.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Pour the dry mixture into the dry mixture and stir just until combined.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Fill muffin papers about three-quarters full.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Bake for 15-18 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Allow to cool for a couple of minutes, then remove from muffin tinransfer to a wire rack to cool completely.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://audreywatters.s3.amazonaws.com/2021-11-17-chickpea.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some Baking Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bookmarked Kelly Jones Nutrition's recipe for chickpea banana muffins before I started this project, thinking that I'd like to try it for its lack of added sugar and its use of chickpea flour, a flour that is high in protein. And initially, I thought I'd bake the recipe and use it as an excuse to talk about different flours and what they can impart — in terms of nutrition and taste — to baked goods. I'll do that in the future, with another muffin recipe. And I'm trying to amass as much data about different ingredients as I can and find a useful way to present that information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://audreywatters.s3.amazonaws.com/2021-11-17-chickpea2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I queued up this recipe to bake, I decided that I'd make a few changes to what is already a really great recipe — changes that I undertook as part of the experimental nature of this project. What if I substituted peanut butter for the avocado oil? What if I added some baking powder and salt? Of course, the flaw with my experimental model here is that I'm not actually making the original recipe; I'm just tweaking it to my needs. So I don't know how I'm messing with the flavors or textures. Are these better tasting than the original? I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I really like this muffin a lot. As I was mixing up the batter, I was a little apprehensive because the chickpea flour does smell very strong. And I worried that I'd be eating an unsweetened banana falafel. But I absolutely love how light and fluffy these muffins are. I only had crunchy peanut butter in the pantry, and that's given a bit of texture to them. It's also enhanced the nuttiness of the chickpea flour. But these definitely aren't sweet at all. And as such, I don't think they'd be everyone's cup of tea. Nonetheless, I am really pleased with how they've turned out. (They freeze pretty well too.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll use the chickpea flour and nut butter — separately and in combination — in future recipes, for sure. In fact, the next batch I'm baking includes the latter…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Better Oatmeal Cookie Recipe</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I ask Kin what kind of cookies he'd like me to bake, he reminds me of how he ranks his favorites: peanut butter are okay; chocolate chips are good; better are my molasses cookies; and the best are oatmeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a pretty good oatmeal cookie recipe online a while ago. (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#recipe&quot;&gt;Jump to the Recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) It makes a soft cookie — a necessity — but it's just too sweet for me. Kin loves it, and to be honest, when I bake cookies they're really to fit his taste-buds. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://food.audreywatters.com/2021/10/19/the-better-peanut-butter-cookie&quot;&gt;after trying the miso-peanut butter cookies&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago, I thought I'd see if I could make a batch of oatmeal cookies that were less sweet, with the umami that miso adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel quite validated about using miso in my baking, incidentally, particularly after Crystelle, a contestant in this season's &lt;em&gt;Great British Bake Off&lt;/em&gt; incorporated it into a couple of her caramel contributions this past week. &amp;quot;It's like salted caramel,&amp;quot; she explained to the skeptical judges. &amp;quot;YES!&amp;quot; I shouted at the television. (She won Baker of the Week too, I might add.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably should have just modified my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe to make it &amp;quot;healthier,&amp;quot; but instead I googled the whole &amp;quot;healthy oatmeal cookie&amp;quot; thing and opted to try one with far less sugar. And as I've never actually baked this recipe before &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; miso, it's hard to judge fully how the addition of that ingredient affected the texture and taste. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;recipe&quot;&gt;Soft Oatmeal Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is based on the recipe that appears on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sugarspunrun.com/big-soft-oatmeal-cookies/#recipe&quot;&gt;Sugar Spun Run&lt;/a&gt; blog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px&quot;&gt;Prep time: 40 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooking time: 10 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Servings: 34&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Calories: 116&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 cup unsalted butter, softened&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 cup brown sugar&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup granulated sugar&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 eggs&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 tsp cornstarch&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tsp baking soda&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;3/4 tsp salt&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;3/4 tsp cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Using a stand mixer, cream the butter and sugars.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Add eggs, one at a time, beating until combined. Then add in the vanilla extract.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture until completely combined.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Stir in oats.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Chill dough in refrigerator for 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 375 and line cookies sheets with parchment paper.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Drop cookie dough by rounded 2 tablespoon-fulls onto the parchment paper -- about a dozen per sheet. (These will spread slightly.)&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Bake for 10 minutes. They will look underbaked, but will finish cooking on the cookie sheet as they cool.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Allow cookies to cool completely on cookie sheet.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not-So-Sweet Miso Oatmeal Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is based on the recipe that appears on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wellplated.com/healthy-oatmeal-cookies/&quot;&gt;Well Plated&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px&quot;&gt;Prep time: 40 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooking time: 10 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Servings: 24&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Calories: 73&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 1/4 cup quick oats&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 cup white whole wheat flour&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 tsp salt&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 tbs white miso&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tsp vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;7 tbs honey&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a large bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a medium bowl, combine the applesauce, melted butter, miso, egg, vanilla, and honey. Whisk until blended.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and stir just until combined. The dough will be very wet and sticky. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 350.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Drop 1.5 tablespoon size balls of dough onto cookie sheet - one dozen will fit per sheet. This dough will not spread, so flatten the balls slightly.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Bake for 9 to 10 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Cool on the cookie sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://audreywatters.s3.amazonaws.com/2021-11-10-oatmeal.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some Baking and Tasting Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &quot;healthy&quot; cookies were smaller, and as such, it's a bit silly to make too much out of a calorie comparison. &lt;a href=&quot;http://food.audreywatters.com/2021/10/06/what-is-a-healthy-muffin&quot;&gt;That word &quot;healthy&quot; is a tricky one in any baked good&lt;/a&gt;. I mean, yes, there was less sugar and less fat. &quot;Healthy&quot; though? Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used one tablespoon less honey and one tablespoon less butter than the original recipe, adding in two tablespoons of miso. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee. But I wish I'd used old fashioned rolled oats rather than the quick oats that the original suggested. That made them very soft and almost cake-like, and I think the texture that old fashioned oats provides is much better, much... well... oatier. Interestingly, these cookies stayed soft for a long time - is that a result of the fermentation from the miso? I don't know. The peanut butter-miso cookies held their softness as well. (I'm not sure how I'd find the answer here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All-in-all, I think I'll stick with making the first recipe when baking oatmeal cookies for Kin. But my experimentation with miso - in cookies and otherwise - will continue...&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Leftovers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two servings of paella in the fridge. There's one or two of beef stew. And I'm making chicken pot pie — serves 6, I reckon — for dinner tonight. So tomorrow night: leftovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've done fairly well in reducing the amount of food I cook each evening now that it's just Kin and me for dinner. There are often leftovers, but typically we'll eat them the next day for lunch. But every once in a while, he'll get too caught up in meetings and will miss lunch. (Me, I never miss a meal.) Or I'll make something that the recipe says serves 6 and actually serves 10. That paella, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we do have an overabundance of food, I'd like to be able to take a meal out to Ashley, the homeless woman who frequents the park across the street from our apartment building. I even bought some paper plates and plastic forks so that I could do so. Inevitably, she seems to disappear the days that I have something to share. (She did get some birthday cake - I think that's the last time I've been able to feed her.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate throwing out food. Doing so is one of my &amp;quot;triggers&amp;quot; when it comes to food, I suppose, as I was often chastised as a child for not eating everything that was on my plate. I know the stereotypical admonishment is something about &amp;quot;starving children in Africa.&amp;quot; But I remember being told by my aunt that it was more a matter of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; being a wasteful American than any condition of a faraway child. She wasn't wrong, of course. She would invoke wartime Britain — one that I think she was born after, to be honest — in which there was food rationing. And I would (silently) invoke my preference to not eat the fatty bits of a lamb chop. That didn't make me indulgent, for crying out loud. But I always feel like that shirking, embarrassed little girl when I misjudge how much food should be on my plate or in a meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating leftovers also reminds me of how my mother structured our weekly meals: she'd cook a roast on Sundays, then we'd proceed to have variations on that meat throughout the week. The final night was almost always a curry, which my dad said was because curry powder was used to disguise rotten meat. Racist and wrong. And I've always loved Indian food, even though I tend to not like leftovers. Or rather, I never really liked meat that much, particularly night after night after night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the problem with leftovers: the repetition of a food I struggled to eat the night before. That's not how I cook or eat today, but the reluctance remains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Tyranny of CICO (with Chocolate Muffins)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Great Muffin Experiment, No. 5&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;#recipe&quot;&gt;Jump to the Recipe&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've lost about 40 pounds this year through the only real &amp;quot;scientific&amp;quot; method of weight-loss: CICO — Calories In/Calories Out. That is to say, I've taken in fewer calories than my body has used. Now that I'm weightlifting, however, I'm trying to put on some weight. And it's CICO again, except this time I'm taking in more calories than I burn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are probably millions of websites dedicated to weight loss, and I've fallen down quite a few rabbit holes trying to figure out how much to eat and what to eat in order to, at first, lose weight, and now gain muscle. Unfortunately, many of these sites give women — particularly women my age — a ridiculously low number for their TDEE, Total Daily Energy Expenditure, an estimate on how many calories a day one's body burns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an Apple Watch, which does tell me how many energy I supposedly use when working out. But I don't know that the numbers are particularly accurate. Nonetheless, I've started tracking all sorts of data about my health in general, and my diet and exercise specifically. It's pretty easy to see how quickly this sort of attention can turn into disordered behaviors — obsession about food, exercise, weight, and so on. And so it's a real challenge, I think, to find a good balance with one's health, particularly with that notion of CICO hanging over one's head: the relationship between calorie consumption and calorie burn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've stopped paying attention to the numbers that Apple gives me for my calorie burn. But I do still monitor my calories — at first I did this with the MyFitnessPal app. But as it is really designed for weight loss, I've recently switched to another app, MacroFactor, that helps me focus on — as the name suggests — my protein macros while smoothing out any daily fluctuations in my weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Watching my calories&amp;quot; hasn't really altered what I cook for dinner each night, although it has made me very aware of portion sizes (and the distortions that occur therein with nutrition labels). But I do plan out what I'm going to eat each day — and how many calories that'll be — in part because I've really struggled with the &amp;quot;bulking&amp;quot; part of my diet. Contrary to the sites that tell me I should eat 1500 calories a day, I need to eat about 2200. That 700 calorie difference? That's about two pounds of body weight — weight I don't want or need to lose, thank you very much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even at 2200 calories — particularly at 2200 calories that are protein-focused — I want my post-workout meals to be really dialed in. I have a rough budget of about 500 calories for pre- and post-workout meals each day: a 230 calorie protein bar, a 120 calorie Greek yogurt, which leaves about 150 calories for a muffin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Yes, we're getting to the part about muffins.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Baking with Chocolate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, boasts a lot of health benefits: antioxidants! lower blood pressure! prevents heart disease! And cacao, the seed pods from which cocoa is made, is also a popular &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; food, with its own set of perks. Plus — and this is really the key — chocolate is delicious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there are many good reasons to put chocolate in your muffins. Except adding chocolate — in the form of cocoa powder, cacao nibs, chocolate chips, or what have you — will certainly increase the calorie content of your baked goods. A half a cup of cocoa powder — about the amount that would go into a batch of a dozen muffins — adds about 170 calories to the mix, or about 14 calories per muffin, for example. Adding a third of a cup of chocolate chips adds another 200 calories to the recipe — plus quite a bit of sugar and fat to each muffin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I'd try my hands at making a low-calorie, high-protein chocolate muffin. As there were beets in the weekly CSA, I figured I'd make chocolate beet muffins. Why not. I found a recipe that I tweaked in order to reduce the calories. More details on that below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think I &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt;-substituted; I was not very scientific in my experimentation, and I made too many changes. And as a result, when the muffins came out of the oven quite dry, I'm not sure I can diagnose exactly where I went wrong (or if the original recipe would have been equally flawed). I'll write another blog post soon about how to troubleshoot a failed recipe, but I want my main point to be this: the tyranny of CICO. Don't let &amp;quot;calories in&amp;quot; screw up what you eat. (And don't let &amp;quot;calories out&amp;quot; screw up how much your body needs to move. But that's another story.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's absolutely okay to indulge in something that's full of sugar and fat and calories. And if you force yourself to eat a shitty muffin — for the record, I should clarify, these are not shitty at all and I'm really enjoying them with my morning Greek yogurt — for the sake of your diet, then you're missing out on the beauty of food. Everything you eat should be good — taste good, make you feel good, and ideally good for you. (And chocolate is good for you, the scientists say!) But &amp;quot;good for you&amp;quot; without the other two — taste and pleasure — undermines your whole journey towards health.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;recipe&quot;&gt;Chocolate Cacao Beet Muffins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is based on the recipe that appears on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://minimalistbaker.com/wprm_print/36025&quot;&gt;Minimalist Baker&lt;/a&gt; blog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px&quot;&gt;Prep time: 10 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooking time: 20 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Servings: 12&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Calories: 130&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 batches of flax eggs (2 tbs ground flax seed plus 5 tbsp water)&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 cup beet puree&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup brown sugar&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 tsp salt&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 1/2 tsp baking soda&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup banana, mashed&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup plain kefir&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 tbps coconut flour&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 1/3 cup whole wheat pastry flour&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/3 cup cacao nibs&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 375 F. Line 12 compartments of standard muffin tin with paper (or grease tin).&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Mix together the dry ingredients in a bowl.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a separate bowl, beat together the flax seed and water, then add the other wet ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the wet ingredients. Stir swiftly, until combined. The batter should be thick, but spoonable. Add more liquid if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Gently fold in the cacao nibs.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Spoon batter into muffin tins, filling almost to the top.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Bake 15-20 minutes or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Cool for 5 minutes before taking out of the tin.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://audreywatters.s3.amazonaws.com/2021-10-27-muffin.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some Baking Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original recipe had 1/4 cup of maple syrup and 1/3 cup of brown sugar, along with 1/4 cup of coconut oil. I substituted a banana for the oil. Typically this is a one-to-one swap, but I increased the amount of banana to compensate for ditching the maple syrup entirely. I substituted kefir for unsweetened almond milk in the original. I also decreased the amount of brown sugar in the original, from one-third to just one-fourth a cup. I added some coconut flour, in the hopes of making the crumb soft. Ha. And finally, I used cacao nibs rather than chocolate chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The batter was really dry, and as a result, I think I overmixed it - just to incorporate all the ingredients, I had to stir a lot and add another tablespoon or two of water to moisten it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://audreywatters.s3.amazonaws.com/2021-10-27-muffin2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some &amp;quot;Health&amp;quot; Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By ditching the oil and some of the sugar, I did reduce the calories from 175 in the original to just 130. Having never made the original, it's hard to say what I lost in flavor. The original describes these muffins as &quot;fudgy,&quot; and I'm not sure if that's code for &quot;very dense&quot; or if it's code for &quot;pretty chocolatey.&quot; I might try to make these again the next time I get beets in the CSA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My changes added just a tiny bit of protein to the muffin from the original; obviously, fat and carbs decreased. And the addition of cacao nibs introduced some caffeine into the mix, something that reminds me to work on a batch of muffins that actually focuses on caffeine - something I like to have before I lift weights (although I usually eat muffins afterwards, so...)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Better Peanut Butter Cookie Recipe</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that it's fall, I'm hoping that I can spend more time baking cookies. This spring and summer, the fruit CSA has kept me busy making cakes and pies and crumbles and the like. And those are all delicious, don't get me wrong. But I love cookies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm toying with beginning another project here on this site, along the lines of &lt;a href=&quot;http://food.audreywatters.com/muffins.html&quot;&gt;The Great Muffin Experiment&lt;/a&gt;. For now, I thought I'd bake two different recipes of the same kind of cookie and see which one Kin and I prefer. (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#recipe&quot;&gt;Jump to the Recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) That's the funny thing about all the SEO focus of recipe blogging: there are hundreds of blog posts touting &amp;quot;the best&amp;quot; whatever, but I'm not even sure you can really say that the author did a lot of work in identifying their recipe as such. Plus it's all so damn subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take peanut butter cookies. I think they tend to be rather dry. I prefer my cookies soft and chewy. Kin agrees. So I found one recipe that touted softness and chewiness, along with another that has a totally different set of ingredients and instructions. These recipes made less than two dozen apiece, so I don't have an overwhelming amount of cookie on hand at the end of this experiment. And I like the idea of actually trying a bunch of cookie recipes before deciding what one is, indeed, the best for our taste-buds here. I mean, I already have a go-to recipe for oatmeal, chocolate chip, and molasses cookies — &lt;em&gt;but what if I'm missing out?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;recipe&quot;&gt;Super Soft Peanut Butter Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is based on the recipe on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lecremedelacrumb.com/best-super-soft-peanut-butter-cookies/&quot;&gt;Creme de la Crumb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px&quot;&gt;Prep time: 10 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooking time: 10 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Servings: 21&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Calories: 169&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 1/2 cups flour&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tsp baking soda&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 tsp salt&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;3/4 cup creamy peanut butter&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup unsalted butter&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;3/4 cup brown sugar&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup granulated sugar&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 tbs Demerara sugar&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 350 F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a medium bowl, whisk together dry ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;With a stand mixer, cream the butter, peanut butter, and granulated and brown sugars until light and fluffy - about 5 minutes. Mix in the egg and the vanilla extract, scraping down the sides, until blended.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Add the dry ingredients to the wet, and mix until just combined.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Roll dough into 2-3 tbs size balls. Roll in Demerara sugar.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Place balls on cookie sheet, about 2 inches apart. (You should fit 12 on a sheet.) Use a fork to make a criss-cross pattern.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Bake for 8 minutes. Do not overbake!&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Allow to cool for 1 minute on sheet, then move to a cooling rack.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Peanut Butter-Miso Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is based on the recipe by Krysten Chambrot that appears in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020538-peanut-butter-miso-cookies&quot;&gt;The New York Times Cooking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px&quot;&gt;Prep time: 30 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooking time: 20 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Servings: 21&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Calories: 156&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 3/4 cup flour&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;3/4 tsp baking soda&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 tsp baking powder&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup unsalted butter&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 cup brown sugar&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup granulated sugar&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/3 cup white miso&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup creamy peanut butter&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup Demerara sugar&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and baking powder.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a stand mixer, combine the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar and beat until light and fluffy - about 5 minutes. Add the peanut butter and miso, then mix in the egg and the vanilla extract, scraping down the sides, until blended.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Add the dry ingredients to the wet, and mix until just combined.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Refrigerate dough for at least two hours, but as long as overnight.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Roll dough into 2-3 tbs size balls. Roll in Demerara sugar.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Place balls on cookie sheet, about 2 inches apart. (You should fit 12 on a sheet.)&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Bake for 14 minutes. Remove sheets from oven and smack the sheets on the stovetop. This will flatten the cookies. Return to the oven for another 2-4 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Allow to cool for 1 minute on sheet, then move to a cooling rack.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some Baking and Tasting Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &quot;super soft&quot; cookies are fairly soft, but I think it's because they are on the verge of being under-baked. They have retained that stick-to-the-roof-of-the-mouth, cloying sensation of peanut butter. I didn't have any Demerara sugar on hand when I made these and just rolled them in granulated sugar instead (that's what the original recipe suggested), which didn't impart the rougher texture that I'd have prefered. Then again, these are so sweet, I'd say the extra sugar could be optional. I made the batch on Sunday, and while they haven't dried out too much in 48 hours, peanut butter always seems to be a dry cookie. That's something that Kin and I do not want in a &quot;best&quot; version.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the miso-peanut butter combination seems to address that problem. (Although in fairness, I ate one soon after it came out of the oven and cooled. Perhaps it'll be drier and crunchier in a few days. The latter is a big no-no for Kin.) I cut the amount of granulated sugar in half from the original recipe, and I didn't roll these in Demerara sugar either. While I like the saltiness and savoriness that the miso imparts, unfortunately, I think it overpowers the peanut butter almost entirely - and this is after letting them sit overnight in the fridge, which the recipe insisted would &quot;mellow&quot; things out. Depending on how the cookies hold up after a couple of days on the counter, I might try this recipe again with more peanut butter (and probably less butter to compensate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://audreywatters.s3.amazonaws.com/2021-10-19-pb.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All-in-all, I think we're still on the hunt for a better peanut butter cookie recipe...&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making Substitutions in Muffins (and a Quick Lesson on Buttermillk)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Great Muffin Experiment, No. 4&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;#recipe&quot;&gt;Jump to the Recipe&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;The New York Times Cooking&lt;/a&gt;, and I happily pay for a subscription to the website/app. I enjoy browsing the recipes; I even like the recipe recommendations, in part because they seem to operate off of very little personal data about me or analysis of my clicks. Like, I just made pancakes, but thanks for suggesting three more variations. And, if you knew me, you'd know I will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; make rice pudding, NYT. Nonetheless, the &amp;quot;Recommended For You&amp;quot; section consistently gives me ideas for things I didn't even know I wanted to make, and I often use it for inspiration rather than for &amp;quot;search&amp;quot; — that is, for finding a specific recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, The Ringer made the case that The NYT Cooking was &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/2019/2/7/18214477/nytcooking-comment-section&quot;&gt;the best comment section on the Internet&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; And unlike virtually every other website, I actually do look at the Notes on the recipes I decide to tackle. I think it's a bit of a stretch to say some of these are &amp;quot;the best,&amp;quot; - there's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/nytimescookingcomments/?hl=en&quot;&gt;an Instagram account that highlights some of the most hilarious ones&lt;/a&gt; - but in all fairness, plenty are useful. (Tonight, for example, I am making &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014468-coconut-chicken-curry-with-cashews&quot;&gt;chicken coconut curry with cashews&lt;/a&gt;, and I appreciate the note that says the three cups of chicken broth the recipe indicates is far too much.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the comments on The NYT Cooking (and elsewhere) involve substitutions. Angry commenters on The NYT Cooking often complain that a recipe sucks when they've made a silly one: apple cider vinegar for apple cider, for example. (Don't be like that.) Patient food bloggers field these sorts of questions about swapping one ingredient for another in the comment sections of their sites: &amp;quot;what if I substitute rice flour for almond flour?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;can I use oat milk instead of half-and-half?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I don't have any cardamom. What spice should I use instead?&amp;quot; And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the recipes I'll be baking as part of this muffin experiment will use substitutions — indeed, that's partly how I'll make these recipes my own. And I'll write lots of posts in the coming weeks and months that will look in detail at how to substitute different flours, different fats, different sugars, &lt;em&gt;and why&lt;/em&gt; into a batch of muffins. But here I want to talk about substitutions in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of good reasons why you'd want to use a different ingredient than one the recipe indicates — most obviously when you don't have that item in your fridge or pantry. Or perhaps the reverse is true: you have a seasonal abundance of an item — say, zucchini — and you'd like to use it up. Or you might want to make a substitution because of health goals, food allergies, or any number of other dietary issues or preferences. Regardless of the reason, &lt;em&gt;the key to changing a recipe is understanding how an ingredient works in the recipe&lt;/em&gt; — how does it affect the taste; how does it affect the chemical reactions that occur while cooking; how does it affect the nutrition; how does it affect the appearance? A recipe isn't a random collection of ingredients; with this in mind, you have to approach substitutions in a somewhat scientific way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Substitute Buttermilk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you type &amp;quot;how to substitute&amp;quot; into Google, you can see by the autocompleted suggestions that one of the most common culinary searches involves how to substitute for buttermilk. A lot of recipes still call for buttermilk, even though I can't imagine it's a terribly popular drink. Buttermilk is like a vestigial organ; it's still in our recipes even though we really don't use it anymore. I mean, not quite vestigial, I suppose - it is great for baking. My grandma cooked a lot with buttermilk; and she always had it in her fridge. (But she drank it straight too — gah!) In the muffin recipe below, that is one of the substitutions I've made from the original. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike my grandma, I do not keep buttermilk on hand, even though I regularly bake from recipes that call for it. I also do not follow what is the Internet's top suggestion for making the substitution: adding one tablespoon of white vinegar to a measuring cup, and then filling it the rest of the way with milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That gives you vinegar milk, which is not remotely the same as buttermilk, even though, yes yes, they're both acidic. Vinegar milk lacks the creaminess of buttermilk, particularly if you're like me and only keep a low-fat milk in stock. (You want the acid - in the buttermilk or in the vinegar - to create the chemical reaction with the baking powder. Baking powder - how does it work - is another future blog post. But long story short, that's why you don't just substitute plain milk for buttermilk.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buttermilk is &lt;em&gt;fermented&lt;/em&gt; milk, and I do, in fact, keep on hand fermented milk in several other forms, namely sour cream, Greek yogurt, and kefir. (I use the latter in my smoothie every morning, so I guess I shouldn't mock my grandma too much for drinking buttermilk.) These are much better options for substitutions, in my opinion, than a thin, vinegar-soured milk.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;recipe&quot;&gt;Buckwheat and Amaranth Muffins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is based on the recipe by Martha Rose Shulman that appears in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014143-buckwheat-and-amaranth-muffins&quot;&gt;The New York Times Cooking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px&quot;&gt;Prep time: 10 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooking time: 20 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Servings: 16&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Calories: 118&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;3/4 cup whole-wheat flour&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;3/4 cup buckwheat flour&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 tsp baking powder&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tsp baking soda&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 tsp salt&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup amaranth flour&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 eggs&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/3 cup honey&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 1/2 cup kefir&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tsp vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 cup blackberries tossed with 1 tsp all-purpose flour&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 375 F. Line 16 compartments of standard muffin tin with paper (or grease tin).&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Mix together the dry ingredients in a bowl.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a separate bowl, beat together the eggs, honey, kefir, applesauce, and vanilla extract.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the wet ingredients. Stir swiftly, until combined. The batter should be thick, but spoonable.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Gently fold in the blackberries.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Spoon batter into muffin tins, filling almost to the top.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Bake 15-18 minutes or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Cool for 5 minutes before taking out of the tin.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://audreywatters.s3.amazonaws.com/2021-10-13-muffin.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some Baking Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original recipe said it made twelve muffins; my recipe makes sixteen. The original said bake for 25 minutes; thankfully I read the comments on The NYT Cooking who told me they'd bake much more quickly than that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I confess: I made a substitution, when I baked these, to my own substitution listsed above: the original calls for canola oil; I've suggested applesauce instead. But when I baked these, I used a homemade pear sauce, because it's pear season. I should have probably skipped the blackberries because it's no longer blackberry season, and the berries I bought were both too large and too tart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://audreywatters.s3.amazonaws.com/2021-10-13-muffin2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amaranth gave these a delicate nutty taste, and I plan on making this recipe again (without the berries). I've also got plenty of the flour on hand now to experiment with it in other recipes. Amaranth is a good source of protein and fiber. That said...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some &amp;quot;Health&amp;quot; Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, my experiments with substitutions, while beautifully successful in terms of taste, were a failure when it came to my health goals. I didn't manage to increase the protein substantially by substituting kefir for buttermilk; but I did increase the carbs, including the sugar, by substituting the pear sauce for the canola oil. (The fat content did go down.) These muffins have 4.5 grams of protein, 23 grams of carbohydrates, and 1.4 grams of fat - more carbs and more sugar than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://food.audreywatters.com/2021/10/04/what-is-a-muffin&quot;&gt;Basic Muffin Recipe&lt;/a&gt;, for crying out loud.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What to Do with Leftover Muffins?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Great Muffin Experiment, No. 3&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;#recipe&quot;&gt;Jump to the Recipe&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm only a couple of bakes into this project, and already I am faced with the question: &lt;em&gt;what the hell am I going to do with all these muffins?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, everything goes in the freezer, and I thaw a couple of muffins at a time. A batch of muffins is typically twelve, so if I bake every other week or so, I shouldn't have a problem eating my way through my supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, sometimes, the recipe kind of sucks; sometimes, the batch doesn't freeze well; sometimes, the freezer is full. And sometimes, you want to — maybe you even need to — transform the muffins into something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might I suggest &lt;s&gt;bread&lt;/s&gt; muffin pudding?&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;recipe&quot;&gt;Muffin Pudding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is based on Mark Bittman's Simple Bread Pudding recipe in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012636-simple-bread-pudding&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px&quot;&gt;Prep time: 10 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooking time: 45 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Servings: 6 to 8&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Calories: 382&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 cups milk&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 Tbsp butter&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tsp vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/3 cup sugar&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Pinch of salt&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;5 to 6 cups of muffins, broken into 2&quot; pieces&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 eggs, beaten&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;fresh fruit (optional)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 350 F. Butter a 4 to 6 cup baking dish and fill with the muffin pieces. Add fresh fruit, if desired.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In a small saucepan over low heat, warm the milk, butter, vanilla, sugar, and salt. Cook until the butter is melted and the sugar is dissolved.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Cool the mixture. Then add the beaten eggs. Pour this over the muffins.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Bake for 30 to 45 minutes until the custard is set but still a little bit wobbly.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Serve warm or at room temperature.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://audreywatters.s3.amazonaws.com/2021-10-07-muffin.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some Baking Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the leftovers from &lt;a href=&quot;http://food.audreywatters.com/2021/10/04/what-is-a-muffin&quot;&gt;the batch of Basic Muffins&lt;/a&gt; I made for dessert, along with a couple of fresh plums from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.froghollow.com&quot;&gt;my local fruit CSA&lt;/a&gt;. No surprise, many of the complaints one might have about that recipe - not that sweet, not that rich, not that flavorful - were addressed by the addition of more egg, more butter, more sugar, and more milk. Of course, if one's complaints were those muffins just weren't healthy enough...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>What Is a Healthy Muffin?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Great Muffin Experiment, No. 2&lt;/strong&gt;  (&lt;a href=&quot;#recipe&quot;&gt;Jump to the Recipe&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always paid some attention to my nutrition. Growing up, my mother made sure that every dinner had a protein, a starch, and a vegetable, for example, as well as the requisite glass of milk for my brother and me. I learned about the food pyramid in school. Cartoon PSAs taught me that &amp;quot;You are what you eat&amp;quot; and that &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/U3jgo5ea_zc&quot;&gt;cheese and crackers were a good choice for snacking&lt;/a&gt;. Much to my family's chagrin, I became a vegetarian when I left home at age 16 — I'd never really liked meat — but didn't really think much about protein until I became pregnant at 20. All that is to say, I've paid &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; attention to my nutrition, but I've actually known very little about it, other than the received knowledge from school, family, and television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that my attention has turned to my health and well-being, I'm trying to learn more. But wow, I see so much of the conflicting messaging — the &amp;quot;science&amp;quot; and the bullshit — about what we should be eating, about what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; should be eating as someone who's very physically active (and trying to put on muscle through weight-training). And what makes it worse, I'd argue, is that the more you search online for answers or products, the more you get ads that try to sell you on the latest trend: keto, paleo, whatever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you search for healthy recipes, you also run into similar sorts of problems — both with the business of &amp;quot;clicks&amp;quot; and the business of &amp;quot;health.&amp;quot; Recipe blogging is a finely-tuned SEO machine. The photos — let me tell you — are gorgeous. The prose isn't always &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bad. But the recipes, particularly when you're interested in items that are &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; or that have more protein, are pretty hit-or-miss. Indeed, I've found that in order to boost the protein levels, many of these recipes simply include protein powder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this one, for example:&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;recipe&quot;&gt;Banana Buckwheat Protein Muffins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is based on the recipe from &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitseats.com/recipes/banana-buckwheat-protein-muffins&quot;&gt;kits.eats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px&quot;&gt;Prep time: 10 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooking time: 20 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Servings: 12&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Calories: 132&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;200 g bananas (about 3 small bananas)&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 cup Greek yogurt&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup maple syrup&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;100 g buckwheat flour&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;60 g whey isolate protein powder&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tsp baking powder&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 tsp baking soda&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup cacao nibs&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 350 F. Line 12 compartments of standard muffin tin with paper (or grease tin).&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Mash bananas in a medium bowl. Add yogurt and syrup and mix well.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Mix together the dry ingredients in a bowl.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the wet ingredients. Stir swiftly, until combined. The batter should be thick, but spoonable. Add milk if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Spoon batter into muffin tins, filling about two-thirds full.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Bake 15-18 minutes or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Cool for 5 minutes before taking out of the tin.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://audreywatters.s3.amazonaws.com/2021-10-06-muffin.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some Baking Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the recipe for these fairly closely, substituting Greek yogurt for the soy and whey isolate protein for the plant-based one in the original. I made 12 muffins, not 8 as the kits.eats' recipe indicated. The batter was very runny, and I was concerned the muffins wouldn't hold together. They did, although they didn't really rise much and they were a bit too chewy. (I don't think I over-mixed the batter — often the cause of a chewy muffin. I'll write more soon on how to troubleshoot things like flat muffin-tops.) The texture of the crumb was fine, but they were rather bland — they didn't taste much like banana &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; buckwheat (and the cacao was more of a crunch than a flavor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://audreywatters.s3.amazonaws.com/2021-10-06-muffin3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buckwheat flour, for what it's worth, does have slightly more protein than wheat flour, and I'll experiment with more protein-rich flours in my bakes in lieu of just adding a protein powder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://audreywatters.s3.amazonaws.com/2021-10-06-muffin2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some &amp;quot;Health&amp;quot; Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am looking for in a healthy muffin: lots of protein and fiber and very little sugar or sodium. Or, at least 5 grams of protein; at least 2.5 grams of fiber; less than 10 grams of sugar; less than 10 grams of fat; and less than 200 milligrams of sodium. (These numbers might seem arbitrary. In many ways, they are! The main questions I'm working with in this series are: can I make a muffin that has more protein than any ol' basic muffin, and can I make a healthy muffin that tastes great?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For comparison, &lt;a href=&quot;http://food.audreywatters.com/2021/10/04/what-is-a-muffin&quot;&gt;the Basic Muffin&lt;/a&gt; has 3.5 grams of protein; .7 grams of fiber; 5.4 grams of sugar; 3.8 grams of fat; and 238.5 milligrams of sodium. This Banana Buckwheat Protein muffin has 7.6 grams of protein; 2.7 grams of fiber; 8.5 grams of sugar; 2.5 grams of fat; and 189.3 milligrams of sodium. (Yes, it has twice the protein than the basic muffin, but that comes almost entirely from adding the two scoops of protein powder.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>What Is a Muffin?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Great Muffin Experiment, No. 1&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;#recipe&quot;&gt;Jump to the Recipe&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I bake cupcakes, Kin will call them &amp;quot;muffins&amp;quot; just to annoy me. &amp;quot;They're cupcakes,&amp;quot; I insist. &amp;quot;Are they?&amp;quot; he'll tease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are they, indeed. What exactly &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a muffin, and how is it different than a cupcake? &lt;em&gt;Or is it&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easy to joke about confusing the two. Both are baked in muffin tins — muffin tins often lined with cupcake papers. And the etymology doesn't help clarify things — a cake baked in a cup seems obvious. But the word &amp;quot;muffin&amp;quot; is possibly derived from the Low German &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;muffen&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; plural of &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;muffe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;small cake.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etymonline.com/word/muffin&quot;&gt;Possibly, etymologists say&lt;/a&gt;, because what we know now as the small cake-like muffin is different from the small yeasted bread known as the crumpet or English muffin. It's confusing! (But Kin's jokes still aren't funny.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, ways we can and do distinguish the two: cupcakes can be frosted, for example; muffins are less likely to be, although they can be glazed. Muffins purport to be healthy; you can get away with eating one for breakfast, while it's generally frowned upon to eat a cupcake for the first meal of the day. I say &amp;quot;purport to be healthy,&amp;quot; because muffins are still quite sweet and even with &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; additions like flax seed and oats and dried fruit, they can contain about as much sugar and fat as a cupcake. There are, for what it's worth, about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/starbucks/chocolate-chunk-muffin&quot;&gt;440 calories in the Starbucks Chocolate Chunk Muffin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the difference between a muffin and a cupcake is not in the ingredients or the calories or the topping or the time of day they're consumed. Rather, &lt;strong&gt;the difference is in how the batter is assembled&lt;/strong&gt;. Cupcakes are, as the name suggests, typically made the same way that cakes are: by creaming the butter and sugar, then adding the eggs and beating until light and fluffy. The dry ingredients — flour, salt, and baking powder, for example — are then added alternately with milk. Muffins are more akin to a quick bread insofar as the dry ingredients (including the sugar) are mixed together; the wet ingredients are mixed together separately; and then the two are combined quickly, without too much stirring, which would develop gluten and make the muffins chewy. Lumps are bad in your cake batter; lumps are fine in your muffin batter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This distinction works well right up until you consider all the &amp;quot;just add water&amp;quot; varieties of &amp;quot;instant&amp;quot; (read: microwavable) mixes. Then, I guess, it's quick breads all the way down.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of The Great Muffin Experiment, I will be making a variety of muffins in my quest for the perfect, &quot;healthy&quot; muffin. But let's start without any preconceived notion of what's &quot;healthy&quot; — I'll write about that next — and look and what goes into your basic muffin. 




&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;recipe&quot;&gt;Basic Muffin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is based on the basic muffin recipe from Mark Bittman's &lt;em&gt;How to Cook Everything&lt;/em&gt; cookbook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px&quot;&gt;Prep time: 10 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooking time: 20 minutes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Servings: 12&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Calories: 133&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;3 Tbps melted butter&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;2 cups all-purpose flour&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup sugar&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1/2 tsp salt&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;3 tsp baking powder&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;1 cup milk, plus more if needed&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 400 F. Line 12 compartments of standard muffin tin with paper (or grease tin).&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Mix together the dry ingredients in a bowl.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Beat the melted butter, egg, and milk in a bowl.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the wet ingredients. Stir swiftly, until combined. The batter should be lumpy, not smooth but quite moist. Add more milk if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Spoon batter into muffin tins, filling about two-thirds full.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Bake 18 minutes or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Cool for 5 minutes before taking out of the tin.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some Baking Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we think of this as the &amp;quot;ur&amp;quot; muffin — a stretch, but bear with me — then there's lots of room for exploration and - apologies to Mark Bittman - improvement. All the ingredients are variables to be played with — more or different sugar, different flour, different fat, for starters. And that's some of what I'll explore throughout The Great Muffin Experiment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://audreywatters.s3.amazonaws.com/2021-10-04-basic.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &amp;quot;ur&amp;quot; muffin or not, I found these to be quite bland, not surprisingly. I wouldn't complain too much about the level of sweetness, but the only real flavor came from the butter. The texture of the muffin was fine — perhaps a little dry. (I could have added more milk, I suppose, as Bittman recommends. I also could have cooked them a bit less than what the recipe called for, I think.) The biggest drawback, however, was that these didn't freeze well, which is something I am definitely looking for as I cannot eat a dozen muffins that quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(As such, I now have 10 rather dull and dry muffins that I have to do something with. How about &lt;s&gt;bread&lt;/s&gt; muffin pudding?!)&lt;/p&gt;
