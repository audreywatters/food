          <p>&#8220;Got any special plans for Father&#8217;s Day?&#8221; the cashier asked us, as she rang up our groceries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just cooking that corned beef,&#8221; I replied, pointing to the brisket in her hand.</p>

<p>To be honest, I&#8217;d planned on cooking it long before I realized today was Father&#8217;s Day. It&#8217;s a Sunday, and Sundays are for cooking some sort of roast. I do so not because we eat a big traditional midday meal on Sundays. Rather a roast means leftovers, and I can start the week knowing that there will be something to pack for lunch on Monday, something to transform into subsequent meals as well.</p>

<p>The only problem, of course, is that I really don&#8217;t love roasts. Or to be a bit more accurate, I don&#8217;t much like roast beef. Or to be more accurate again, I didn&#8217;t much like roasts when I was growing up. But now that I&#8217;m an adult, now that I&#8217;m more interested in cooking and in eating, I&#8217;m getting better at preparing this meal. </p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t really like many of the roasts my mother would cook for us, although I&#8217;d sometimes enjoy the leftovers &#8211; that is, until they dragged on into the third or fourth day and I started to question if it was time for a curry because she&#8217;d exhausted all other ideas or if, in some sort of British imperialist awfulness, curry was something I associated with meats that had gone a bit gray.</p>

<p>I definitely did not like roast corned beef when I was growing up, always wishing we could just cut out the middle meal and go straight to the corned beef hash (which I later learned my grandmother would make from a can, not from a piece of beef that she&#8217;d brined and baked). I think my father had told me some sordid story about corned beef being rotting meat preserved with salt, and I couldn&#8217;t get the taste of rot out of my mind. </p>

<p>I did not like any of the meats that would appear from the crockpot where my mother would cook her corned beef &#8211; ham, short ribs, beef goulash, corned beef, all yuck. These were all less delicious cuts of meat, I knew as the butcher&#8217;s granddaughter, that needed to be cooked &#8220;low and slow&#8221; in order to tenderize them. They also tended to have large chunks of fat &#8211; truly the most disgusting part of any meaty meal and the part I&#8217;d have to sit and stare at, uneaten on my plate, before I could be excused from the kitchen table. </p>

<p>I can be excused from the table any goddamn time I want now. I can leave a big chunk of gristle or tough piece of meat on my plate. I can cook a roast with the leftovers in mind. I&#8217;m having corned beef hash for breakfast tomorrow, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
