          <p>I made sloppy joes for dinner the other night. The checker at the grocery store &#8211; the one who always tries to guess what I&#8217;m cooking based on the ingredients in my cart &#8211; asked what I had in mind. &#8220;Ooo. What&#8217;s your recipe?&#8221; she asked, as she scanned my items. </p>

<p>&#8220;Um,&#8221; I answer rather sheepishly. &#8220;It&#8217;s just the classic sloppy joe thing: mustard, onion, green pepper&#8230;&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;Ketchup?&#8221; she adds. </p>

<p>&#8220;Actually, no,&#8221; I tell her. &#8220;The last time I made them, I used ketchup and the mince was too sweet. So I&#8217;m trying tomato sauce and enough brown sugar to get the sweet level right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just can&#8217;t make them quite like I remember them tasting like they did when I was a kid,&#8221; she lamented.</p>

<p>And I agreed. I think when we were kids, ketchup was the most delicious sauce I could imagine. I wanted its bright red sweetness to overwhelm the taste or texture any meat that was placed in front of me. But now, as an adult, I rarely use ketchup at all. I find its flavor overwhelming. Awful. Hell, I&#8217;ll eat fries without ketchup (on the odd occasion I order fries).</p>

<p>The sloppy joes without ketchup turned out fine. I was able to adjust the sweetness of the sauce &#8211; something that really is the marker of the dish, no doubt &#8211; dialing it down to my old-age taste buds. </p>

<p>When I tried my hand at recreating fig newtons yesterday, I was reminded again of that gulf between foods you remember fondly from childhood &#8211; all the sweetness, the processed ingredients &#8211; and what those foods taste like (and make your body feel like) when you&#8217;re older. </p>

<p>I can&#8217;t remember the last time I ate the Nabisco trademarked variety. I know that they come in all sorts of flavors these days. I&#8217;ve had the Newman variety more recently, I suppose. It&#8217;s a snack that reminds me of my grandmother, who always seemed to have a cupboard full of pre-packaged crap like that &#8211; crap I&#8217;d never get at home. Neither fig newtons nor sloppy joes are &#8220;comfort foods.&#8221; But they are things that remind me of some of the joyful moments of eating food that, as a kid, I felt was made for me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d purchased some figs at the store the other day that, when I bit into one, I realized weren&#8217;t quite ripe. So I decided to cook them into something. I&#8217;m not sure why I decided that I&#8217;d make a fig jam and roll it inside a whole wheat cookies, but that&#8217;s what I did. Like the sloppy joes, they turned out better than the original. I added cardamom to the dough. The fig jam was made with honey and actual ripe figs not high fructose corn syrups and <a href="https://youtu.be/ygqOFNpJhpQ">whatever-the-hell-that-fig-thing-is-in-this-video</a>. That&#8217;s the trick of recreating foods that have that nostalgic aspect to them, I think. Recreate the joy of eating food that is actually made for you.</p>
