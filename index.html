<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is going to turn into a memoir. But if I had to pen something along those lines, it would certainly have to do with food &#8211; growing up in Wyoming with a British mother who&#8217;d gone to college to study &#8220;domestic science,&#8221; which included cooking; growing up the granddaughter and daughter of grocers, who ran for quite a long time a successful small business; watching the sides of beef get unloaded from the trucks that had come from Denver, the smell of cold cow blood turning my stomach against meat at a pretty young age; being forced to sit at the dinner table until I had cleaned my plate; living with my aunt and uncle and cousins in England when I was 9 or 10, and being told I had to eat the long bend of fat that I&#8217;d carefully cut free from my lamb or pork or beef because &#8220;we aren&#8217;t wasteful like you Americans&#8221;; finishing my dinner and being rewarded with the nastiest of desserts. I loved to cook, then I hated to cook, and now, after years of dining out every night, I am cooking again. I love to eat, but there is a lot of stuff that I refuse to. Having control over that is one of my favorite things about adulthood.</p>
