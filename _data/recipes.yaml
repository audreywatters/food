  ingredients:
  - 1/2 cup/5 ounces mashed bananas (from about 1 large or 2 small ripe or overripe bananas)
  - 1/4 cup cup/55 grams dark brown sugar
  - 1/4 cup/50 grams melted virgin coconut oil
  - 2 teaspoons lemon juice
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  - 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
  - 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
  - 2 cups/200 grams old-fashioned rolled oats
  - 1/4 cup/30 grams walnut halves, roughly chopped
  cuisine: American
  date: 2020-12-08
  instructions:
    - Preheat oven to 325 F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.
    - Combine the oats and nuts in a medium bowl.
    - Add the mashed banana to a medium saucepan along with the brown sugar and coconut oil. Stir to combine. Cover and cook over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the pot comes to a sputtering boil. (You’ll hear it popping.) Cook for another 60 to 90 seconds, swirling the pan often so the mixture doesn’t burn.
    - Remove the pan from the heat, allow the sputtering to subside, then stir in the lemon juice, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Fold in the oats and walnuts until combined.
    - Spread the mixture out on the prepared sheet pan in an even layer. Using a spatula, press the oats down into a layer that is about 1/2-inch thick. Bake for 25 minutes, rotating halfway through, then remove the sheet pan from the oven and, using a butter knife, break the granola into large, 2- to 2 1/2-inch clusters on the baking sheet.
    - Spread the clusters evenly around the pan and bake again until the clusters are a deep golden brown, another 15 to 20 minutes, rotating and tossing halfway through so they don’t burn.
    - Remove the pan from the oven and allow the granola to cool for at least 30 minutes on the counter to harden slightly. Once the granola has cooled, break it up with your hands into small or medium clusters, depending on preference. Allow to cool completely, at least one more hour.
